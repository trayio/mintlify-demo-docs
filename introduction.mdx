Welcome to the documentation for the Tray Universal Automation Cloud!

Use these docs as a complete reference for all topics and features involved in building low-code automations and turning them into templatized integrations that can be activated by End Users.

## Key resources

- [Key concepts](/tray-uac/getting-started/key-concepts/) to instantly familiarize yourself with the Tray Build UI
- [Quickstart](/tray-uac/getting-started/quickstart/) to run through key building essentials with a ready-built project
- [Embedded quickstart](/tray-uac/embedded-integrations/quickstart/) to learn how to convert the same quickstart project into a templatized integration ready to be activated
- [Governance](/tray-uac/governance/org-management/tray-org-setup/) for all necessary info on managing your Tray organization
- The [Tray developer tools](https://developer.tray.ai/developer-portal/dev-tools/connector-tester) which are referenced throughout documentation and act as powerful assistants in your building journey

## Using the Tray Academy

[The Tray Academy](https://academy.tray.io) is a companion to our documentation and acts as a meticulously detailed learning environment to build your expertise in Tray and level-up from beginner to advanced in a structured manner.

It does this through detailed examples, walkthroughs and interactive labs.

Many of the topics covered in documentation act as jump-off points to Academy interactive labs.

This helps:

- **New users** to first gain a good basic understanding of a topic before going through an interactive lab.
- **Technical users** who may only need an overview of methods involved before putting things into practice
- **Users who have already completed an Academy interactive lab** and need reference material as a reminder of what is involved
