Once you have built a complete API, it is possible to download the OpenAPI spec.

This can be done by going to the 'Operations' section of your project and clicking on 'Download OpenAPI specification':

Below are some ways in which you could make use of your OpenAPI specs in order to manage your APIs as an organization and deliver a smooth experience for users of your APIs:

- **Generate Documentation with industry standard tools:**
- **Build an API Explorer: **Provide a sandbox environment where developers can explore and test API endpoints without writing any code
- **Request and Response Validation: **Validate incoming requests and outgoing responses against the OpenAPI spec to ensure they conform to the defined schema
- **Security and Compliance: **Ensure your API adheres to security standards
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): **Integrate OpenAPI spec validation and testing into your CI/CD pipelines to automatically check for compliance and regressions
- **Automated Testing: **Generate automated tests for your API endpoints based on the OpenAPI spec
- **SDK Generation: **Provide SDKs in various programming languages to simplify integration for developers
- **Collaboration: **Facilitate collaboration between frontend and backend teams, product managers, and other stakeholders 
- **Standardization: **Ensure consistency and adherence to best practices across multiple APIs within your organization

## Notes on using OpenAPI specs

- Users with all roles (including viewer) can download a spec. Users are not able to modify or override anything on the API by clicking this button
- Every time the 'Download...' button is clicked a new spec is generated based on the latest update to your API
- Specs are generated in json using OpenAPI v 3.0.0
