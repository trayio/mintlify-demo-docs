## Making basic calls

In order to make actual POST / GET etc. calls to your published APIs, you will need to retrieve the base url from the operations section:<br/>

<Warning>
It is not currently possible to whitelabel the base url for your API management projects
</Warning>

<br/>

![app-base-url](/images/platform/api-management/using-the-api/5qjtsq7qWDIbHtDVRv4Oio_app-base-url.png)

<br/><br/>Then you can make any external calls by appending the endpoint path onto the base url:<br/><br/>

## Authenticating calls

To authenticate your calls you will need a client-associated token.

this can then be passed as a bearer with any API calls, i.e.:

```json
{
"Authorization": "Bearer 39e8fh3rfxxxxxxxxxxd9df2e"
}
```
