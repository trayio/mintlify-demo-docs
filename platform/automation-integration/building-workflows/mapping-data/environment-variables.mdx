There is a list of Tray environment variables (prefixed with $.env) that - at any point in your workflow - can be used to access basic info about the workflow/solution environment. These are:

```json
$.env.execution_uuid
$.env.execution_start_time
$.env.execution_log_url
$.env.organization_uuid
$.env.project_id
$.env.solution_id
$.env.solution_instance_id
$.env.source_workflow_uuid
$.env.workflow_uuid
$.env.workflow_title
$.env.workspace_id
```

<Warning>
Tray's `$.env` environment variables are fixed and it is not possible to create custom $.env variables

An alternative approach may be to use project config variables which are entirely customizable and can be accessed using the `$.config` jsonpath

## The execution uuid[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/building-workflows/basic-data-manipulation/environment-variables#the-execution-uuid)

The `$.env.execution_uuid` environment variable is potentially of key importance in managing statuses and errors.

It is the id which is generated every time a workflow is run.

It could be linked to an external execution id (which may have been pulled in from a webhook) - both of which could be stored in Data Storage and retrieved later in the workflow or stored at account level and retrieved in any child workflows which are called.

## The workflow uuid[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/building-workflows/basic-data-manipulation/environment-variables#the-workflow-uuid)

The `$.env.workflow_uuid` environment variable is basically the `uuid` found in your workflow url:

![env-workflow-uuid](/images/platform/automation-integration/building-workflows/mapping-data/environment-variables/4m7J6kdHOq9evEsmV3aG8H_env-workflow-uuid.png)

An example of using `$.env.workflow_uuid` can be found in our documentation on workflow threads

In this case it is used as a suffix for an account-level data storage variable, to identify that the variable is connected to that workflow

## Callable workflow trigger variables[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/building-workflows/basic-data-manipulation/environment-variables#callable-workflow-trigger-variables)

Callable workflows have the following environment variables available from their trigger output:

```json
$.steps.trigger.#calling_workflow
$.steps.trigger.#calling_execution
$.steps.trigger.#calling_execution_log_url
```

The `$.steps.trigger.#calling_workflow` environment variable can be used to obtain the `uuid` of the calling workflow.

Again, this is used in our documentation on workflow threads - to make sure the calling workflow accesses the account-level data storage list that was created by the calling workflow.

## Embedded environment variables[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/building-workflows/basic-data-manipulation/environment-variables#embedded-environment-variables)

There is a further list of environment variables that can be used to access basic info about the solution environment in your Embedded integrations.

These are:

```json
$.env.execution_uuid
$.env.execution_start_time
$.env.user_id
$.env.external_user_id
$.env.execution_log_url
$.env.workflow_uuid
$.env.workflow_title
$.env.solution_id
$.env.solution_instance_id
$.env.source_workflow_uuid
```

For example, if you have a step which produces the following error output:

![trello error output](/images/platform/automation-integration/building-workflows/mapping-data/environment-variables/1T19u2zeLDaqAzF61IoFGN_trello_error_output.png)

You could use the following:

![trello error details email](/images/platform/automation-integration/building-workflows/mapping-data/environment-variables/26hYQd7lzWWD2jJy7HlGmI_trello_error_details_email.png)

To format a message which would produce the following:

![trello error details output](/images/platform/automation-integration/building-workflows/mapping-data/environment-variables/68sIqtsBwENYcXryCWjIKQ_trello_error_details_output.png)

## Environment variables and fallback values

<Warning>
When building Embedded Solutions, you should set fallback values when using environment variables. 

For example, `$.env.solution_instance_id `is only available in the solution instance context and you will get errors while testing the master workflow as the jsonpath isn't yet available.
</Warning>
