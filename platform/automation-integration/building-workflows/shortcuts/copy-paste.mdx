It is possible to copy and paste workflow steps either by **selecting the [...] options button**  or by **right clicking the step:**

You can also **click and drag to multi-select**:

By right-clicking the `+` icon the step(s) can then be pasted to any step - in any workflow in any project.

When you copy a step you also copy the configuration.

**This will save you time and effort** especially in workflows that need several similar steps.

Some examples for wanting to repeat workflow steps include:

- You wish to **repeat a set of steps** and their configuration **in the same workflow.**
- The **same steps** are needed **in a separate** or [callable](#) workflow.
- You wish to create **similar but slightly different steps (paste then edit)**
- You wish to **save steps and their configuration for future use** in any workflow.

## Choosing a method

Where you wish to reproduce your workflow step will dictate the best copy / paste method:

### DUPLICATE** **

You wish to **create an identical / similar step** within your **current workflow** either next to or **in close proximity to your copied step**.

### COPY / PASTE** **

You wish to **create an identical / similar step in another section of your workflow**. Or within **a completely separate workflow** 

### SAVE SNIPPET 

You wish to **save this step and its configuration for repeated use long term**.
