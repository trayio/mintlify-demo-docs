Due to the potential size of workflows, it can be difficult to locate a particular workflow step.

This is where the **Step Search bar** can help you locate particular connector steps (and triggers) within your workflows.

The 'Step Search bar' is **located within the Builder sidebar** above the 'Connector library' icon.

Once the desired step is found **the search bar will automatically redirect you to the chosen connector step and property panel**.
