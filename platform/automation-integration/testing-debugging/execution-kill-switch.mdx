## Overview

There may be occasions when the running execution(s) of a workflow has become dangerous.

Some example scenarios are:

- An incorrect setting means that data is going to be pulled from the wrong source or pushed to the wrong destination
- An incorrect setting means that some data is going to be wiped
- A badly-configured loop is running infinitely

Whatever the reason, if you need to immediately stop all executions of a workflow you can do this with the 'Stop all executions' button:

You will be presented with the following warning:

## Important notes

- All running executions of the workflow will be stopped **once the current step for each execution is completed**. 
- This is not the same as the 'disable' button as it **only stops executions that started before the button is pressed**. 
- To stop **all past and future executions** this functionality would need to be used **alongside the disable workflow functionality**.
