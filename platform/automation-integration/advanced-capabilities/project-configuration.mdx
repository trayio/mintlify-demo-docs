In any project you can set 'project level config':

![project-config-data](/images/platform/automation-integration/advanced-capabilities/project-configuration/1Li0NcX6wyNegdKI3dgbnl_project-config-data.png)

This is data that can be re-used throughout your workflows e.g. notification email addresses, service IDs, base URLs etc.

It can then be referenced as e.g. `$.config.project_email`

![config-data-project-email](/images/platform/automation-integration/advanced-capabilities/project-configuration/4UQGkDQYaGEoM1lLQL08DJ_config-data-project-email.png)

This is great for 'single-sourcing' data - i.e. if this data changes you only need to update the config data and it will propagate throughout the workflow

It is also possible to set config data by using 'convert to config' from within the properties panel itself:<br/>

## Config data for Embedded End Users[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/building-workflows/basic-data-manipulation/config-data#config-data-for-embedded-end-users)

Project config can be made available to End Users of your Embedded integrations, to enable them to personalize the integration for their own use.

Please see our documentation on [Config slots](#) for more information.
