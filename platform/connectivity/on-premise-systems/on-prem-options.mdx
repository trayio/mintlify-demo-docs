Tray offers several options for On-prem setups which can help you comply with your infosec requirements for execution runtimes with 3rd party vendors:

## Tray's On-prem agent

As the '**default' option**, Tray's on-prem agent offers a simple to configure enterprise-grade solution which creates a secure connection with Tray which allows Tray's connectors to communicate directly with your key services and databases.

When using the on-prem agent you do not need to open up your services to the internet - Tray authentications for your on-prem services can make use of your internal private IP address and port / proxy configurations, and you can shut down access to your public IP.

## AWS-specific options

For AWS customers who may prefer to use AWS out-of-the-box options, the following options are also available:

- Transit Gateway 
- PrivateLink 
- VPC Peering 

## Private site-to-site VPN

The generic (non AWS-specific) **private site-to-site VPN** solution allows Tray to establish a secure IPSec tunnel to your VPN gateway device. This requires opening your firewall to inbound traffic from Tray.

While this is also secure and effective, there is considerable technical overhead in setting this up on your network, which will require the involvement of an engineering team.

## Tray Public IPs

For customers who have public-facing resources they would like to access Tray, **Tray public IPs are available by default** for all service connectors, so it is just a matter of allow-listing the IPs with your firewall.
