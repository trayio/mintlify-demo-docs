<Warning>
Note that these IP addresses are only used by default by connector traffic. 

Other outbound traffic related to authentications (for example, OAuth traffic) does not necessarily originate from these IP addresses. 

If you need a fixed set of outbound IPs for authentication traffic, please contact us.
</Warning>

For all services, you can allow-list the Tray **public IPs**, so that you are not opening your services to the world:

The list of IPs, based on your region are as follows:

**US**

- `52.40.200.248`
- `52.39.10.61`
- `52.26.59.155`

**EU**

- `108.129.66.83`
- `54.73.116.155`
- `63.33.233.130`

**APAC**

- `3.105.252.6`
- `54.79.191.214`
- `3.24.148.13`

Once you have allow-listed these IPs with your firewall to ensure that you are only accepting communications from Tray.io, you can then forward them to the correct ports for your on-prem services.
