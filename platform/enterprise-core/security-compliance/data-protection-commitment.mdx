## Cross-Border Transfer[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/governance/security-and-compliance/data-protection-commitment#cross-border-transfer)

The GDPR regulates transfer of personal data related to EU residents outside of the EEA to ensure the continued protection of such data outside of the EEA. In July 2023, the EU Commission issued a decision that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection – compared to that of the EU - for personal data transferred from the EU to US companies participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Tray has committed to comply with a detailed set of privacy obligations and therefore complies with the requirements of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. This ensures that personal data processed by Tray in the US continues to be safeguarded in accordance with the GDPR or UK GDPR.
