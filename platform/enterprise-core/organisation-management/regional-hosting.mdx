description: "A Tray instance can be hosted in one of the following Data Regions: US, EU or APAC. This can help ensure that business data will never leave the region that it originated in, and compliance with data regulations according to your region."

<Info>
Regional hosting in Tray is available for the following packages:

- Team (optional add-on per region)
- Enterprise - all regions available as standard
</Info>

A Tray instance can be hosted in one of the following **Data Regions**:

- US 
- EU 
- APAC 

This can help ensure that business data will never leave the region that it originated in, and compliance with data regulations according to your region.

## Accessing multiple orgs in one region[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/governance/org-management/regional-hosting#accessing-multiple-orgs-in-one-region)

A Tray User can access **one Organization in a given region per unique email address**.

If you need to access another Org (e.g. a client you are working as an integration consultant for) in the same region, you can be added to their org by using a `+` modifier.

e.g. if you already have a login for `roger@acme.com` and you are working as a consultant for a client you could use `roger+clientName@acme.com`

If you have specific requirements for migrating existing company emails, please contact support.

## Multi-region setup[​](http://localhost:3000/docs/governance/org-management/regional-hosting#multi-region-setup)

Depending on your package and use case, you can have Tray instances in multiple regions, for example when:

- You are a **multi-national company **and your staff need to login to an instance which is hosted in the same region they work in
- You have built **Embedded integrations which End Users configure for their own use**, and your **End Users will be in multiple regions**, then you can deploy a Tray instance in each region which contains the same projects and solutions
