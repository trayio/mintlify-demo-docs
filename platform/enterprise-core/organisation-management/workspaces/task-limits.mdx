This page brings together all information on technical limits of connectors on the Tray Platform.

Some of this information is repeated on relevant connector pages.

## Timeout information

| **Case** | **Policy** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How long does a connector take to timeout? | 45 seconds<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>120 seconds if built and deployed by you using [CDK](https://developer.tray.io/developer-portal/cdk/introduction/) | is longer on certain connectors such as the CSV connectors and Redshift (Redshift setting is 60 minutes) |
| How long does the HTTP Client (Universal Connector) wait for a response? | 15 mins |  |
| How long does the [Webhook Trigger](/documentation/connectors/triggers/webhook-trigger/) wait (when using [trigger event reply](/documentation/connectors/core/trigger-event-reply/)) | 5 mins |  |
| How long does the Authentication refresh wait before throwing an error - such as 'unable to refresh OAuth token.' | 1st retry is immediate | 2nd and 3rd retries wait approx 20 seconds |
| How long does the 'Fire and Wait for Response' operation in the '[Callable response](/documentation/connectors/core/callable-workflow-response/)' connector wait before timing out? | this doesn’t have a timeout as a workflow could take a long time to complete |  |

## Connector retry logic

| Case | Policy | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service connector API returns an error | Retry 3 times every 40 seconds | Retries 3 times only if set to stop workflow, error handling retries 0 times
| Internal Tray.io error (backend) | Retries 15 times regardless of error handling | Delay increases each time. First retry after 30s, then 2mins, etc. 10th time will wait for 30 minutes. "Unfortunately, we encountered an internal error..." |
| Backend Error (connector itself) | Retries 3 times regardless of error handling | "Unfortunately, the connector unexpectedly failed..." |
| Wrong user input (e.g. wrong [jsonpath](https://tray.io/documentation/tray-uac/building-automations/workflow-data-basics/mapping-data-between-steps/#editing-jsonpaths)) | Doesn’t retry regardless of error handling | Use error returned to troubleshoot |
| A service trigger / webhook is retrying | If the service which sends the webhook doesn't receive a 200 status from Tray.io, this will depend on the retry policy of the service | An example policy is [QuickBooks](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/webhooks#configuring-webhooks) which retries every 20, 30, and 50 minutes |
| Service connector is not retrying a failed API call  | Will only retry a failed API call if the error handling logic is set to 'Stop workflow'  | 'Manual' & 'Continue workflow' logic - Api/ connector error: doesn’t retry internally, generic backend error: retries 3 times internally |


## Data payload limits

| Case | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data that can pass between any 2 steps in the workflow builder | 6 MB | any more will cause issues |
| Data that can be sent using the [Trigger Event Reply](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/core/trigger-event-reply/) | 1 MB |
| Data that can be consumed by our Webhook Trigger | 1 MB | file content can be sent as multi-part http requests, with an overall limit of 10MB |
| Data that can be sent via the [Form Trigger](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/triggers/form-trigger/) | 1 MB (10 MB for attached files) |
| Data that can be attached to an [inbound email](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/triggers/email-trigger/) | 10 MB |


## Link persistence

| Case                                               | Policy  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| How long do files generated in a workflow persist? | 6 hours |


## CSV connectors

| Case | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| Data that can be extracted from, or sent to, the [CSV Editor](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/core/csv-editor/) in a single call | 1 GB | more is likely to cause issues |
| File size limit when [importing to the CSV Editor](https://tray.io/documentation/tray-uac/building-automations/workflow-data-basics/managing-csv-files/) | 1 GB |
| Max payload between steps for [CSV Reader](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/core/csv-reader/) | 1 MB | as per between standard connectors in the builder |
| Maximum row size | 8 KB |
| Maximum number of columns | 4096 |
| When I create a CSV how long does this CSV persist for? | 30 days |
| When I export my created CSV I get a download url How long is the download URL active for? | 6 hours | as per standard link persistence policy |

## Logs retention

| Case                             | Policy  | Notes                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| How long are logs retained for?  | 7 days or 30 days depending on package| can be reduced on request |
| How long can logs be re-run for? | 7 days  |


## The Data Storage connector

| Case | Policy | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall storage limit | none |
| Storage limit under single key | 400 KB |
| Nested depth limit | 32 | for more deeply-nested objects the 'set value' operation can use the 'Force store in older format' option in advanced properties. |
| How long is data stored under **Current Run** scope? | 30 days from execution | to allow for delays in workflow completion |
| How long is data stored under **Workflow** scope? | until deletion of the workflow |
| How long is data stored under **Account** scope? | until deletion of the workspace |


## Webhook trigger rate limits

| Case                             | Policy  | Notes                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 'Auto respond with status 200' operation  | No rate limiting | |
| 'Validate and respond' operation | Rate limiting applies  | If too many requests (i.e. several hundred per second) come in to your webhook trigger at once, Tray.io will respond with an HTTP 429 (too many requests) error
Please be sure to throttle requests appropriately at the source third-party service |
| 'Await workflow and respond' operation | Rate limiting applies  | If too many requests (i.e. several hundred per second) come in to your webhook trigger at once, Tray.io will respond with an HTTP 429 (too many requests) error
Please be sure to throttle requests appropriately at the source third-party service |
| 'Await workflow and respond' operation | Response size limit  | If the combined size of the 'status', 'body and 'header' in a trigger event reply step is larger than 2MB then the request will fail with a 504 after several retries |
