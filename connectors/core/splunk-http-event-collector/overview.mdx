## Overview

Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) is a fast and efficient way to send data to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.<br/>Notably, HEC enables you to send data over HTTP (or HTTPS) directly to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud from your application. HEC was created with application developers in mind, so that all it takes is a few lines of code added to an app for the app to send data.
