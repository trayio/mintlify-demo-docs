# Overview

## Overview

The Mustache connector can be used as a simple way of turning values returned by other connectors into variables that can be used in messages.

Mustache connector uses the popular templating library **Mustache.js**. You can refer to this [readme](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js#readme) for more reference.

This can help you to work with your data in a more systematic manner.

As well as the example below, please see the following template for some Mustache in action:

## Example 1: Autofilling data Slack blocks

This short video explains how you can use the Mustache connector to auto-populate your Slack blocks.

Key points covered in this video are:

- How to use the Slack Block Kit Builder to create a template for your Slack notification.
- Placing double curly brackets `{{example}}` around your block properties will mean the Moustache connector can later inject the properties into your Slack code block dynamically.
- Doing so means you can simply and easily change the properties and / or values of the Slack Block code whenever you like without having to rewrite the Slack Block code itself.

## Example 2: Turning values into variables

The following workflow gives a very simplified example of this:

Here we have:

1. Used the first Salesforce connector to **List Opportunities** (returning Account Id, Name, Owner Id and Amount for each)
2. Used the Loop connector to process each opportunity one-by-one
3. For each opportunity, **Got Owner Name** in Salesforce
4. Used **Mustache Template** to create template variables using outputs from all of the above and set the message using these variables
5. Sent the formatted message to a Slack channel

From the screenshot above you can see that we have created a list of **Parameters** for the **Mustache Template** step, by clicking the **Add Property to Parameters** button:

In the Template code box we have then been able to create a message which includes the parameter variables enclosed in `{ }`:

The debug output for one opportunity in the loop would then show:

And there would be a series of messages sent to the Slack channel which you have set in the final step:

## Example 3: Using Mustache templates in config data

You could also use mustache template variables in your config data messages.

For example you could set a standard 'new opportunity' message in **Configurable data** in your workflow settings:

This message can use `{ }` to use a mustache variable:

Then for any Mustache step in your workflow you can set the parameter and make the **Template Code** pick up the config message for a new opportunity:

The debug output will then show that the config data 'new opportunity' message and Mustache parameter have combined to correctly format the message:
