# Overview

## Overview

Companies use NetSuite for enterprise resource planning (ERP) and to manage inventory, track their financials, host e-commerce stores and maintain customer relationship management (CRM) systems. This flexible platform can be applied to a range of business applications.

## Authentication

### Prerequisites

To use NetSuite SOAP web services the relevant **SOAP Web Services must be enabled **within your NetSuite account. 

Additionally the SOAP web services **user must have the required permissions** **assigned to said userâ€™s role**.

If you already have your features and permission setup then please move straight to **Stage 3: **[Creation](https://staging.tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/netsuite/#creation).

### Stage 1: Enable Features

This accordion guides you through the process of enabling token authentication and SuiteAnalytics for NetSuite REST API authentication integration with Tray.

### Stage 2: Enable Permissions

This accordion guides you through the process of** setting the permissions required** for the respective features enabled in the previous section.

### Stage 3: Creation

This section begins and ends in the Tray builder so **please have your workflow space set up** before continuing.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Notes on key operations

### Search records

Sometimes you may wish to only select certain fields to be returned. This is especially true if you are intent on performing a "join" in order to reduce the amount of data coming through your workflow.

With an "advanced search records" setup, you can define all the fields you want NetSuite to return as well as a criteria for said records in order to filter the results down further.

**Please see the** **walkthrough below for a demonstration on how you could potentially set up the Tray properties panel**, in order to use with the Contact endpoint (when using the Search records operation).

### Add Record (& Custom records)

This section essentially walks you through **how to reference a custom record **in NetSuite.

Users need to be aware that **custom records are non-standard entities in NetSuite**. You need to adhere to NetSuite's non-standard entity rules when using the **Add record** operation.

**Please see the walkthrough below for a demonstration on how you could potentially set up the Tray properties panel**, in order to use with the Contact endpoint (when using the Add record operation).

## Further Info (REST & SOAP)

The following sections are mainly relevant to SOAP users however there is some cross over for our REST customers.  

## Reverting XML Schema

Despite the fact that the NetSuite APIs (REST and SOAP) primarily deals in XML Tray has taken steps to standardise our NetSuite connectors so that they work using JSON instead. 

However in order for NetSuite to process requests correctly, the input still requires a translation back to XML.

Therefore we have implemented a way to transform JSON back into XML. However this still **requires the JSON object to be in a specific format** in order to talk to NetSuite.

Check out the simple demo below for formatting details and example input / output schemas.
