# Overview

## Overview

Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides messaging between applications reliably and asynchronously by sending publishing messages to a topic and subscribing to that topic to receive messages.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Google Cloud Pub/Sub connector is **https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1. **More information can be found on their main [API documentation (v1.0)](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/apis) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Google Cloud Pub/Sub connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Authentication' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Service Account' credentials.

To create a service account, head to the Google Cloud Pub/Sub [dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?supportedpurview=project) and create a new service account for your selected project. Once created, please copy and paste the entire contents of your service account JSON file. For more information and advice on authenticating with a service account please refer to the Google Cloud documentation [here.](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries)

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub Trigger

The Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when messages are published to a topic that has an associated subscription.

### Trigger Operations available:

- Subscribe

### Subscribe Setup

Select the Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger. This can be done at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Highlight the Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger. In the Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.

The Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger authentication follows the same steps as the connector. Follow the instructions above to authenticate your trigger. Select 'Subscribe' to create a subscription to a given topic in Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

As you can see, the 'Subscription', 'Project' and 'Topic' fields are required in order to subscribe to a topic.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Notes on using Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### Publish/Subscribe

In order to use the trigger in conjunction with the connector, please ensure that the topic subscribed in the trigger matches the topic published in the connector.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub connector to publish a message to a topic and trigger a workflow that has subscribed to the same topic to receive messages.

The overall workflow would look like so:

As you can see the 'Topic' is required and matches the Topic passed in the trigger. The message additionally must be provided and encoded as a base64 string.

Once published, this will trigger the workflow we added the Google Cloud Pub/Sub trigger to with the data we published.
