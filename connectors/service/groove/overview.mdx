# Overview

## Overview

Groove allows users to converse with their customers on multiple channels - such as email, live chat, social media, and phone calls - through one platform. Key features include ticketing, live chat, knowledge management, reporting tools, and customer self-service.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the Groove connector.

In the Groove connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and select the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'Access token' credential.

In order to get the access token, head to your Groove dashboard. Click on the 'Settings' menu, represented by a gear icon. Next, click on the 'Organization' tab.

Within 'Organization', click on 'API'. Here you can find your 'Private Token'. For more information on this, you can visit the Groove API documentation [here](https://www.groovehq.com/docs).

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Groove which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Groove API documentation v1](https://www.groovehq.com/docs), to **find the exact format** that Groove will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set within the Tray app.

The base URL for Groove is: `https://api.groovehq.com`

For example, say that you wanted to use the 'Finding one customer' endpoint. You would use the Groove API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/v1/customers/:customer_email`. In this example, you would replace the `:customer_email` section of the URL endpoint with the email address of the customer whose details you wish to retrieve.<br/>In this example, our 'customer_email' value is `hello@groovehq.com`.

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://www.groovehq.com/docs/customers#finding-one-customer).

So if you know the method, endpoint, and customer email address, you can get the customer information with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/v1/customers/:customer_email`

URL Parameter: Key: `customer_email` Example Value: `hello@groovehq.com`

Body Type : `none`

Final outcome being: `https://api.groovehq.com/v1/customers/hello@groovehq.com`
