# Overview

## Overview

FullStory enables users to track and monitor each customer activity. From clicks to page transitions, everything is indexed automatically.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Fullstory connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Authentication' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will easily identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'API Key'.

In order to get these fields, head to the Fullstory dashboard. Click on the vertical hamburger icon on the top right corner and select 'Settings'.

Navigate to 'Integrations' > 'API Keys'.

Here you can create an API Key using the 'Create key' button.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Notes on using Fullstory

### Get user

The Get user operation provides the data about users who have been identified in the browser. It uses 'User ID' to fetch the user details from Fullstory.

User ID is a six-digit number found in the User's profile on your Fullstory dashboard.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Fullstory connector to list session details for a given email address.

These sessions are then counted and a daily notification of the total session count is sent to [Slack](/connectors/service/slack/), to keep track of daily browser activities.

Note that you could also send this information to a [Google Sheet](/connectors/service/google-sheets) or a SQL database.

The overall logic of the workflow is:

1. The workflow is triggered by a **scheduled trigger** that runs daily.
2. It **gets the List of all the sessions** based on the specified email address.
3. Loops through the **Session Dates** and compares each with the **Last Run Date** to see if there are any new sessions.
4. **Is new Session?** is a boolean step which checks if each session **occurred after the last run date**. If so, the **Session count is incremented**.
5. Then the **Total Session Count is fetched** and sent as a **Slack notification**.
6. Finally, the **Last Run Date** is set, which will be used in the next run of the workflow

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:
