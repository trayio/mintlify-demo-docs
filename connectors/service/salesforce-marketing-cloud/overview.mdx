# Overview

## Overview

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a provider of digital marketing automation and analytics software and services

## Authentication

When using the Salesforce marketing cloud connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

Sales force marketing cloud uses server to server (Client Credentials) for authentication.

To get the required Client ID, Client Secret and tenant specific subdomain, you will need to create a salesforce market package.

In Marketing Cloud, go to Setup -> Apps -> Installed Packages. 

Click New. Give the package a name and description. 

Save the package. After the package is saved, then click on it to view it. Under Components, click `Add Component` then select `API Integration`. 

Select the `Server-to-server` integration type. 

You will need to select which scopes it has, in this case it's both of `Data Extensions` scopes. 

Once you have setup the component, the package will now look like this: 

 Ensure that the integration type is `Server-to-server`.

Now you can fill in the Client Id, Client Secret & tenant specific subdomain in the tray.io authentication. Note the tenant specific subdomain isn't the full URL, for example:

If your REST API endpoint was `mc563885gzs27c5t9-63k636ttgm.rest.marketingcloudapis.com` then your tenant specific subdomain would be `mc563885gzs27c5t9-63k636ttgm`
