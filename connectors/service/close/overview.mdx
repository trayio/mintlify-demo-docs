# Overview

## Overview

Close is a powerful all-in-one customer relationship management service which offers a fleet of services including calling, email automation, predictive dialers, and more. It is a powerful set of tools to support and strengthen your sales teams.

## Authentication

Add a Close connector step to your workflow. Click on the 'New Authentication' option now available in the right hand panel and name as appropriate.

In order to fully authenticate with Tray.io and Close, you will need a Close 'API Key' which can be accessed by following the steps displayed below:

1. Log into your Close account and select 'Settings' on the side panel.

1. Select 'API Keys' from the Integrations section of the interior side panel.

1. Click the '+ New API Key' button.

1. Give your API Key a name and click 'Create API Key'.

1. Click the copy to clipboard button. It's worth noting that the API Key will not be displayed again. Make sure to store it safely.

1. Paste the API Key into the Api key section of your new authentication and click the 'Add authentication' button.

1. You have now successfully authenticated your Close account in the Tray platform.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example usage - Listing contacts, Looping through the list and Getting each contact

Create a new workflow with a Manual Trigger, a Close connector, a Loop Collection and a second Close connector.

Select the Close connector, authenticate as above and choose the **List contacts** operation.

If you were to run the finished workflow, the log from a successful output would show that this operation returns a **data** array containing the contacts objects.

Then set the Loop Collection connector to **Loop List** and enter `$.steps.close-1.data` as the **List** in order to grab the above contacts one-by-one.

You will note from the output from **List contacts** that each contact object has an `id` output field. You can then, for each contact that is fed by the loop, grab the `id` and pass it into the second Close connector.

The **Get contact** operation is chosen and `$.steps.loop-1.value.id` gets the `id` of the contact from the Loop connector to enter it as the **Contact** to pull the contact from Close.

Once the workflow is set up, click 'Run Workflow' and then click on the 'Debug' tab to look through all the inputs and outputs of a successful run of the workflow.

In real life situations, you will likely be dealing with large numbers of records - dozens, hundreds or thousands. In this case you should make use of pagination tokens returned by the operation, and build a more complex loop as described in our [pagination documentation](https://tray.io/documentation/platform/standard-best-practices/pagination/intro-to-pagination/).
