# Overview

## Overview

Cascade enables partners to create new opportunities and routes to market, by allowing seamless transfer of HR data into workflows, processes, and systems.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Cascade connector is **https://api.iris.co.uk/hr/v2**. More information can be found on their API documentation [site](https://help.iris.co.uk/hr/cascade/api/box1.htm).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Cascade connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' credentials.

These fields will be found in the email received after you sign up to the Cascade HR API.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
