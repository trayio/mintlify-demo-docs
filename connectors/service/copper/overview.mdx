# Overview

## Overview

Copper is a Customer relationship management tool that has been designed specifically for G Suite users. This is so you can see information from all your email threads, past interactions, and tasks all in one place without the need for further data entry. Having all your customer interactions are in one place means can have the visibility needed to manage relationships with full context.

## Authentication

> 

When using the Copper connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, select your workflow. Once in the workflow dashboard itself select and drag the Copper connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) to your workflow.

With the new connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' under the 'Settings' heading.

In the new pop-up window that appears, name your authentication as appropriate and make sure to use the same email address that you used for signing into your Copper account, in the 'Email address' section.

For the API key, head to your Copper account main dashboard, click on the 'Settings' option on the left hand side. In the new menu that displays, select 'Integrations'. You will see a drop down option which will include 'API Keys'. Click on this to get to the main API Keys page.

Click on the 'GENERATE API KEY', and name your new API appropriately.

Copy the new hash created and paste it into your Tray.io authentication pop-up window.

Once you have clicked through again, your authentication should now be complete and available within your Copper connector settings -> 'Authentication' field.
