# Overview

## Overview

WebDAM is a cloud-based digital asset management (DAM) solution that helps businesses streamline workflows by consolidating visual content on a central platform. WebDAM enables users to organize, share and track content, thus helping them manage the content's potential.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Webdam connector is **https://apiv2.webdamdb.com**. More information can be found on their [main API documentation (v2)](https://www.damsuccess.com/hc/en-us/articles/202134055-REST-API) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Webdam connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Client ID' and 'Client secret' credentials.

To get these fields, follow the Webdam [documentation ](https://www.damsuccess.com/hc/en-us/articles/202134055-REST-API#api_connecting)for connecting to the API. 

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
