# Overview

## Overview

AWS Marketplace is designed for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), Value-Added Resellers (VARs), and Systems Integrators (SIs) who have software products they want to offer to customers in the cloud. Partners use AWS Marketplace to be up and running in days and offer their software products to customers around the world.
