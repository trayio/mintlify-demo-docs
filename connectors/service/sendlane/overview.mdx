# Overview

## Overview

Sendlane empowers eCommerce merchants to turn online shoppers into loyal, lifetime customers using the power of behavior-based email marketing automation.

## Authentication

When using the Sendlane connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Sendlane connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Sendlane connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab and 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'API Key' and 'API Hash Key', and 'Subdomain' credentials.

In order to get these fields, head to your Sendlane dashboard. Click on the Cog and the 'API' option.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Sendlane which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Sendlane API documentation v1.0](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7477734/SzYYyxxv#intro), to **find the exact format** that Sendlane will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Sendlane is: `https://SUBDOMAIN.sendlane.com/api/v1`

For example, say that the 'List lists' operation did not exist in our Sendlane connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Sendlane API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `POST` request called: `/lists`.

More details can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7477734/SzYYyxxv#843c2c7c-4468-4178-85b2-ba48aed5d5e7).

As you can see there is also the option to include a body parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your body parameters are, you can get the the list of the first 10 lists with the following settings:

Method: `POST`

Endpoint: `/lists`

Body Type : Raw : `{ "limit" : 10 }`

Body Type : none

Final Example outcome being: **https://SUBDOMAIN.sendlane.com/api/v1**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Sendlane connector, to add a contact to your lists.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list all lists in your account.
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each list.
3. Add a step to add contact to each list individually.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List lists

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Sendlane connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List lists'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

Now when this workflow is run, it will pull down a list of lists from the Sendlane API.

### 2 - Add a loop collection

Next, search for the Loop collection connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Sendlane connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List lists' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

This will enable us to iterate over the list of lists, and perform operations for each one, during each loop cycle.

### 3 - Add contact to a list

The last step is to drag a Sendlane connector inside of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Add contact to a list'. As you can see, the 'List ID' and 'Email' fields are required. Use the same connector-snake method for generating the JSON path to get the 'List ID' field and don't forget to add your contact's email address to the 'Email' field.

Now when this workflow is run, you will add your contact to your lists.
