# Overview

## Overview

SpotDraft is a contract lifecycle management software.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the spotdraft connector is **https://api.spotdraft.com/api/v2**. More information can be found on their main [**Spotdraft API**](https://api.spotdraft.com/api/docs/) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the spotdraft connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your '**Client ID**' , '**Client secret**', '**User email**' and '**Base api url**'.

To get these fields, connect with your customer success rep to get a **client_id** and **client_secret** that you can use to make build out a custom integration with SpotDraft.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.2**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in spotdraft that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [**Spotdraft API**](https://api.spotdraft.com/api/docs/) API documentation v2 to **find the exact format** that spotdraft will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **'Get template metadata'** operation did not exist in our spotdraft connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the

spotdraft API docs to find the relevant endpoint - ***which in this case is a ***`***GET***`*** request called: ***`/public/templates/{template_id}/metadata`

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://api.spotdraft.com/api/docs/#tag/V2-Template-APIs/operation/v2_public_templates_metadata_list).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL: ***  *
- **Body Type: **`None`

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
