# Overview

## Overview

Wicket is a member data platform. It integrates with all the tools your team uses and feeds data back into a centralized database, where you can keep track of the experience your members have across all channels.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the Wicket connector.

In the Wicket connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and select the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'Base URL', 'Admin UUID', and 'Secret Key' credentials.

In order to get these fields, contact [Wicket support](https://support.wicket.io/).

Your base URL will take the format `https://<tenant_id>-api.wicketcloud.com`. Contact support to retrieve your tenant ID.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Wicket which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Wicket API documentation v](https://wicketapi.docs.apiary.io/#), to **find the exact format** that Wicket will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Wicket is: `https://<tenant_id>-api.wicketcloud.com`

For example, say that the 'List people' operation did not exist in our Wicket connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the Wicket API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/people.json`.

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://wicketapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/main-resources/people/fetch-people).

As you can see, there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint, and details of your query parameters are, you can get the .................. information with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `people.json`

Query Parameter: Key: `page[number]` Value: `1`

Final outcome being: **/people.json?page[number]=1**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Wicket connector to iterate over a list of people and add them to a CSV file, ready to be exported.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and retrieve a list of people using the Wicket connector.
2. Create a new CSV file with the required fields.
3. Loop through the list of people fetched in the List people step and add it to the newly created CSV file.
4. Export the CSV as an XLSX file.

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & retrieve a list of people

Select the manual trigger from the trigger options available.

From the connectors panel on the left, add a Wicket connector to your workflow. Set the operation to 'List people'.

As you can see, the 'Page number' and 'Page size' fields are mandatory. The value for the Page size field specifies the number of records to be returned and and the Page number field's value specifies the beginning of the fetched results.

Provide suitable values as per your requirements in these fields.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

When this workflow is run, it will return a list of the first 100 people in your Wicket account.

### 2 - Create a CSV and add records

Next, add a CSV connector as the next step in your workflow and set the operation to 'Create CSV'.

Set the value for the 'Number Of Columns' field as per your requirement. In this example, we have set it to 3 as we need to add values for the three columns specified below, all with a data type as 'Text':

- id
- given_name
- family_name

Next, search for the Loop connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Wicket connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List people' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `data` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

When this workflow is run, it will iterate each record in the list fetched from the List people step.

Add another CSV Editor connector **inside** the Loop step itself, this time with the operation set to 'Add Row'.

Use a connector-snake to find the value for the CSV ID field from the 'Create CSV' step. It should appear similar to this: `$.steps.csv-1.id`.

Then, for all the Cell Values, use the connector-snake again to retrieve the values from the Loop step. They all should appear as follows:

- id: `$.steps.loop-1.value.id`
- given_name: `$.steps.loop-1.value.attributes.given_name`
- family_name: `$.steps.loop-1.value.attributes.family_name`

Now when run, the workflow will add each person's ID, given name, and family name to the CSV file.

### 3 - Export the CSV file

The last step is to drag another CSV Editor step onto the end of the workflow. Set the operation to 'Export CSV'.

Once again, using connector-snake, provide the jsonpath for the CSV ID field as we did in the previous step.

Give your CSV file a suitable name in the Filename field. Make sure to add a .csv extension to the filename.

We have now completed this workflow. When run, it will return a list of people from your Wicket account and export their IDs and names as a CSV file.

You can use the Debug tab to [inspect your logs] (/platform/troubleshooting/logs-and-debugging/) for each step to verify if your workflow is running as expected.
