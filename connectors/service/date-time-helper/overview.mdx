# Overview

## Overview

The Date & Time helpers allow you to manipulate date and time values of various formats from connectors and triggers. These are commonly used for tasks such as converting date/time values to different formats, or finding the difference between two date & time values.

## Formatting the date

A date string or timestamp can be formatted into a particular style of writing using the `Format date` operation of the Date & Time Helpers connector. For instance, '2006-01-22' is represented by `YYYY-MM-DD`, while 'Sun, January 22nd 2006' is represented by `ddd, MMMM Do YYYY`.

Note that you can escape said characters by using either `\` or `[]`. For example, when using the timezone reference: `Z`:

### Table of Formats

Date and Times can be represented in any way you want by combining the variables in the following table.

The Date & Time Helper connector supports time zones that are natively recognized by the JavaScript **Date** function, such as UTC, EST, and other standard time zone abbreviations.

## Important notes

### Comparisons

Please remember that you either need to compare two times or two dates. You cannot compare a date to a time.

The boolean helper can help you compare two date **strings **should the issue arise.
