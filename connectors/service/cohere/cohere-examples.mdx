# Examples

## Generate Text Embeddings

The [**Generate text embeddings**](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed) operation generates an embedding vector that represents input text. 

The generated embeddings can be stored in any vector database and are valuable for performing [similarity searches](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/).

The two possible scenarios of text embedding are explained below: 

1. Creating vector embeddings for your data

2. Querying your vector embeddings to retrieve information

### Generate docs embeddings

To generate document embeddings, you may need to handle batches of data. 

Consider a scenario where you have received a chunk of data through a Webhook. 

**Sample data:**

You can then loop through this data, passing each item one by one to the **Create embedding** operation to generate embeddings.

Since you are looping through batches of data for which you are creating vectors, you will need to create an object that adheres to this structure and append it to a data storage list. 

For a more detailed guide to sending batches of vector data, please refer to the [Pinecone documentation](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/pinecone/#upsert-vectors).

### Generate query embeddings

The following scenario shows a query coming in through a Webhook and being sent to Cohere to create query embedding.

The resulting vector is then passed to a vector database to perform a similarity search.

For a detailed understanding of the parameters involved, refer to Cohere's [Embed API documentation.](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed)

## Generate Chat

Generates a model response for the given chat conversation.

The following example demonstrates one of the use cases for the operation.

It shows a query coming in through a Webhook and being sent to Cohere to create an embedding vector. The resulting vector is then passed to a vector database to perform a similarity search.

The **Generate chat** operation uses the similarity search result to Create a model response for the received query.

For a detailed understanding of the parameters involved, refer to Cohere's [Chat API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat).
