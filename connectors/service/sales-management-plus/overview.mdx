# Overview

## Overview

Sales Management Plus provides CRM, BI and proactive marketing integrated to your ERP system to help you grow your top-line. It allows you to proactively manage your sales process, execute integrated marketing, deliver self-serve dashboards and close more sales.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Sales Management Plus connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Domain' credential.

This 'Domain' is the same as the 'Domain' you enter when logging into Sales Management Plus.

Once you have added this field to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â <br/><br/>You will be redirected to Sales Management Plus and asked to log in, and then asked to allow Tray.io access to SMP.<br/>

Click "Allow". Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
