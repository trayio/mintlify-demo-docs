# Overview

## Overview

The tray.io BigCommerce connector allows you to manage your BigCommerce store.

## Authentication

When using the BigCommerce connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

You will need to enter the *Client ID*, *Access token* and *Store hash*.

- Log into your store and select **Advanced Settings**
- Select **Api Accounts**
- Select **Create API Account**
- Insert any name and the scopes (permissions) to allow the operations to be executed.
- Select **Save**

You will then use the generated Client ID and Access token in your Tray authentication alongside with the Store hash (e.g. If your store url is `https://store-hi1234.mybigcommerce.com` then you will enter `hi1234`).

## Example

In this example we will build a simple workflow to retrieve a list of products from a BigCommerce store.

Create a new workflow with a **Manual Trigger**, and add a step from the **BigCommerce** connector, with the operation set to **List products**. You can either run the workflow immediately or specify some filters, such as *Availability* or *Type*.

The output will be an object with a list of products.
