# Overview

## Overview

RingCentral provides features like call auto-attendant, company directory, call forwarding and handling, multiple extensions, a mobile app for iPhone and Android, Business SMS, video conferencing and screen-sharing, and fax.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the RingCentral connector.

In the RingCentral connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'New authentication' button. This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal.

Name the authentication something that will easily identify it in a larger list. For example using the name of the service account, whether it is a Sandbox or Production OAuth, etc.

When choosing between the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational'), consider who and how many people will need access to it.

As you can see, the next page asks you to select which scopes you would like to enable for your created authentication.

Once you have selected the desired scopes in the Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Upon clicking 'Create authentication', you will be prompted to sign in to your RingCentral account.

Once you have logged into your RingCentral account.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the drop-down options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## RingCentral Trigger

If you wish your workflow to be kicked off by a particular action in RingCentral, you can use the RingCentral Trigger.

The RingCentral trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events occur associated with the selected trigger operation.

### Trigger Operations available:

- Webhook

### Webhook Setup

Select the RingCentral trigger. This can be done either at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Authenticate the trigger using the instructions mentioned in the [Authentication](#authentication) section above.

Select 'Webhook' as the event you wish your trigger to listen to in order to set off the workflow itself.

You can filter the trigger events by choosing the available drop-down options.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example Usage

### Get extension call logs

Below is an example of how you could potentially use the RingCentral connector to list call logs and then store the selective information related to a call in a third-party service. In this case, we are using [Google sheets](/connectors/service/google-sheets/) as a generic placeholder for any service or database you may wish to use.

The workflow steps are as follows:

1. Workflow is triggered using a Manual trigger and lists extension call logs.
2. Loops through the list of call logs received from the previous step.
3. Stores the call log details in a Google Sheet.

The following workflow gives an example of how you can achieve this:

#### 1 - Setup Trigger & list extension call logs

The workflow is triggered using a [Manual](/connectors/triggers/manual-trigger/) trigger.

**List extension call logs** is a RingCentral connector step that return a list of call logs for the selected 'Account ID' and 'Extension ID'.

Alternatively, you can provide a tilde (~) as a value for both the fields to indicate the logged-in account and it's assigned extension within the current session.

We have checked the 'Show blocked' option to include call logs for blocked numbers. You can always uncheck this option if required.

#### 2 - Loop and store call logs

**Loop call logs** is a loop step set to 'loop list' the call logs received from the previous step and uses the `$.steps.ringcentral-1.records` jsonpath.

**Store call logs** is a Google sheets step that stores 'Direction' (`$.steps.loop-1.value.direction`), fromPhone (`$.steps.loop-1.value.from.phoneNumber`), and toPhone (`$.steps.loop-1.value.to.phoneNumber`) attribute details in a Google sheet.

It uses jsonpath for the respective fields from the **Loop call logs** step.

What you would like to store in a third-party service is entirely dependent on your tailored needs.

Once the logs are stored in the Google sheet, they would appear like this:

### Get extension call logs for a date range

The following example is a simple modification to the above workflow where the workflow uses a scheduled trigger to fire the workflow based on the specified intervals.

Also, the call logs are filtered based on the selected date range using the 'Date from' and 'Date to' fields.

Instead of providing static dates, you can always pull the dates for the Date from and to fields using the Polling mechanism explained in the [Polling with last runtime](/platform/standard-best-practices/polling/polling-last-runtime/) document.
