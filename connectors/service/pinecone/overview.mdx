# Overview

## Overview

Pinecone makes it easy to provide long-term memory for high-performance AI applications. It’s a managed, cloud-native [vector database](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) with a [simple API](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference) and no infrastructure hassles. Pinecone serves fresh, filtered query results with low latency at the scale of billions of vectors.

## Authentication

When using the Pinecone connector for the first time, you need to create a new authentication.

Name your authentication and specify the type ('Personal' or 'Organizational').

The next page asks you for your API Key.

To get this field head to the [Pinecone Dashboard](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-Nrj48bGY3xHNl6ZPaFn/projects). Select **API Keys** from the left panel. 

You can use the default key or create a new one using the **Create API Key** button.

Once you have added this field to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the available dropdown options . Your connector authentication setup is now complete.

## Available Operations

### Upsert Vectors

This functionality enables you to store vectors and their associated metadata, either individually or in batches.

When creating a vector, the input schema consists of an array of objects with metadata, a generated ID, and the embedding vector in the 'values' field.

It's important to note that, for retrieval purposes, the original data that the vectors were generated from should be included, such as in a 'text' field in the metadata.

The following screenshot shows an example set of metadata. Note that you are entirely in control of what metadata fields you include. 

 If you're processing batches of data for vector creation, ensure you construct an object adhering to this structure and append it to a data storage list.

The list can then be retrieved and inserted directly into the ‘vectors’ array in the properties panel for the Pinecone **Upsert vectors **step.

## Notes on using Pinecone

### Creating vectors

Note that Pinecone functions solely as a storage database and does not generate vectors. 

To create vectors, you must utilize tools like a Language Model (LLM) with an embeddings model. 

For instance, you can employ the [OpenAI's Create embeddings operation](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/openai/#create-embeddings-available-from-v20), as demonstrated in this example:

The resulting vectors are then added to the vector object as demonstrated [above](https://staging.tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/pinecone/#upsert-vectors).

### Batching

Considering that vectors can contain several thousand numbers, appending to lists may exceed the data storage limit under a single key. 

Therefore, it's advisable to chunk your source data into appropriate batches and utilize a callable workflow for vector creation:
