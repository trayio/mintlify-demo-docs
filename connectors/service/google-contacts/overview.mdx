# Overview

## Overview

The Google Contacts connector allows the user to read, create and update contacts and contact groups belonging to a Google Account.

## Authentication

Click on the **New Authentication** button:

This will open up a window which allows the authentication to be named and also displays the scopes that will be requested.

Once the next button has been hit, you will be redirected to Google and asked to approve the authentication request.

Once it has been approved, you will be redirected back to the workflow view and the authentication will be ready to use.

## Note on Operations usage

As the [Google Drive](/connectors/service/google-drive/) connector holds most of the permissions available for downloading Google files (regardless of type) - it is recommended to try revising your workflow to include this connector, should you face any Google file downloading issues.

## Example 1: Creating a new contact

This example will walkthrough how to create a new Contact for your contact directory on Google.

The first step is to choose the `Create contact` operation.

The first required field is `User email`. `User email` input refers to the account that contact book belongs to. The value `default` which is provided means it will be placed into the contact book of the account that you authenticated with.

For this new contact, a name will be provided using the name input object.

As well as a name, it will be associated with an email address. This is done by creating a new email object in the email array.

This example contact needs to be assigned to a group. This can be done by suppling a group that it belongs to in the Group membership info object.

A note needs to be attached to this contact as well. This can be done using the `notes` field found in the input panel.

The workflow can now be ran as the contact is ready to be created. As can be seen, it ran successfully.

It can also be seen on the Google Contacts UI.

## Example 2: Creating a new contact group

This example will walkthrough how to create a new Contact group for your contact directory on Google.

The first step is to choose the `Create contact group` operation.

The first required field is `User email`. `User email` input refers to the account that contact book belongs to. The value `default` which is provided means it will be placed into the contact book of the account that you authenticated with.

For this new contact group, a name will be provided using the name field.

Added information about the new group can be added using `key:value` pairs in the extended properties object.

The workflow can now be ran as the contact group is ready to be created. As can be seen, it ran successfully.
