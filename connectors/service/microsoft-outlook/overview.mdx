## Overview

Microsoft Outlook is a webmail service that is part of the Microsoft 365 product family. It offers mail, calendaring, contacts, and tasks services.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Microsoft Outlook connector is **https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation (v1.0)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Microsoft Outlook connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your required scopes. Please select according to your use case.

Once you have selected your relevant scopes click the **Create authentication** button.Â The next pop-up will ask you about your Microsoft account details. 

After a successful login to your Microsoft account the connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
