# Overview

## Overview

OneLogin is a complete Identity & Access Management system.

## Authentication

- Access OneLogin as an account owner or administrator.
- Go to **Developers** > **API Credentials**.
- On the **API Access page**, click **New Credential**.
- Give your credential a name. 
- Click **Save**.
- Copy the **client secret** and **client ID** 
- Open the tray workflow, click on **New Authentication**
- Paste the **client secret** and **client ID**
- Click **Next** to save the authentication

## The OneLogin Trigger

The OneLogin trigger allows you to trigger a workflow when an event occurs, for example when a user role is updated.

To setup the trigger, get the **Public URL** of your Tray Workflow, which can be found by clicking on the wheel in the top-left corner of the workflow editor:

- Copy the **Public URL**
- Access OneLogin as an account owner or administrator.
- Go to **Developers** > **Webhooks**
- Set the format type to **JSON Array**
- Set the **Listener URL** to the **Workflow Public URL**
- Click **Save** 

## Example

In this example we build a simple workflow to send a slack message when a user is added to a new role. Create a new workflow with the **OneLogin Trigger**, and select the **Specific event** operation, with the event type set to **USER_ASSIGNED_ROLE**. Add the **slack** service from the list on the left.

You can then send the username to a Slack channel by using the Slack connector and setting its Message property value to a JSONpath of the Webhook's Request Query Parameters.
