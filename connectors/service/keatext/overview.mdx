# Overview

## Overview

Keatext is a turn-key customer feedback management solution that delivers value in minutes and empowers brands with the peace of mind that customers are reflected in every business decision.

## Authentication

## Version 3.0+

When using the Keatext connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the XXXXXX connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Keatext connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab followed by 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Organization' or 'Personal').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'Base URL', 'Keatext Environment', 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' credentials.

As for the 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret', you can only get this information directly from the Keatext team.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Version 2.1 and earlier

When using the Keatext connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Keatext connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Keatext connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'Username' and 'Password' credentials. You need to enter username and password you use to login into your Keatext account.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Keatext which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Keatext API documentation v2.0](https://developer.keatext.ai/), to **find the exact format** that Keatext will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Keatext is: `https://icarusapi.keatext.ai/api`

For example, say that the 'List organizations' operation did not exist in our Keatext connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Keatext API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/organizations`.

More details can be found [here](https://developer.keatext.ai/#operation/get-organizations).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method and endpoint are, you can get the organizations information with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/organizations`

Final Example outcome being: **https://icarusapi.keatext.ai/api/organizations**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Keatext connector, to retrieve information about each dataset of the collection.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and add 'List datasets' step
2. Add 'Loop collection' step to iterate through your datasets
3. Add 'Get dataset' step to gather the information required

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup using a manual trigger and add 'List datasets' step

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Keatext connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List datasets'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

### 2 - Loop Collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous 'List datasets' connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List datasets' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

Now when the workflow is run, the Loop Collection step will iterate through the each item found within the previously created list.

### 3 - Get dataset

The final step is to drag a final Keatext connector *INSIDE* of the actual Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get dataset'. As you can see, the 'Organization ID' & 'Dataset ID' fields ae required.

In the 'Dataset ID' field use the connector-snake once more and assign it to the `id` value, produced by the Loop Collection connector from the previous step.

When run, this workflow will retrieve detailed information about each of the companies found:
