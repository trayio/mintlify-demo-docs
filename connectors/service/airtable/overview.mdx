# Overview

## Overview

Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet.

## **API Information **

The **Base URL** used for the Airtable connector is **https://api.airtable.com/v0/{{base_id}}/{{table}}**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation (v1)](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) site. API limits can be found [here](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits).

## Authentication

When using the Airtable connector for the first time, you need to create a new authentication.

Name your authentication and specify the type ('Personal' or 'Organizational').

<br/>The next step is to select your **service permissions**. 

<br/>Once done, click **Create authentication. **

In the dialog box, select the base or a workspace to which you want to grant access for Tray.io.

<br/>You can select multiple base/ workspace. Once done click the **Grant access** button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the available dropdown options . Your connector authentication setup for Slack's version 10 is now complete.<br/>
