# Overview

## Overview

The FreshSales connector helps you to manage and automate the process around the existing and potential customers.

## Authentication

When using the FreshSales connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the FreshSales connector from the connectors panel (on the left-hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new FreshSales connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab and 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'Subdomain' and 'API key'.

To get the 'Subdomain', head to your FreshSales account and sign in. Select the URL of the FreshSales account.

The URL will be similar to: `https://trayio-org.myfreshworks.com/crm/sales/`.

The subdomain is the hash between `https://` and `.myfreshworks.com`.

In this case, the **Subdomain** is: `trayio-org`.

To get the 'API key' on your FreshSales account, navigate to **Settings** > **API Settings**.

You can use the existing API key or Reset the key.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
