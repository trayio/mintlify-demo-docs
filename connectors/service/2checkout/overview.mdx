# Overview

## Overview

 2Checkout is an electronic payment service (merchant account alternative) ,that **allows merchants to accept online credit card payments from customers in their home country and abroad**.<br/><br/>

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the 2Checkout connector is **https://api.2checkout.com/rest/6.0**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/2Checkout-API/api-rest_documentation/6.0#) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the 2Checkout  connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Vendor Code' and 'Secret' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the 2Checkout dashboard. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner. 

To get the 'Vendor Code' and 'Secret' click on the Settings menu icon as shown in the above image, and choose integrations from the left menu.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in 2Checkout that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the  [API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/2Checkout-API/api-rest_documentation/6.0#)  to **find the exact format** that 2Checkout will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **'issuerbanks'** operation did not exist in our 2Checkout connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the

2Checkout API docs to find the relevant endpoint - ***which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/paymentmethods/IDEAL/issuerbanks`.***`*** ***`

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/2Checkout-API/api-rest_documentation/6.0#/Payment%20methods/get_paymentmethods_IDEAL_issuerbanks_).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL: **
- **Body Type: None**

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
