# Overview

**Data tables** can be used to store data in a table format in order to enable such functionality as **lookup tables.**

Each project has a data tables tab where you can store multiple tables.

These tables can be edited directly in the UI:

To make use of them in your workflows, they can also be accessed programatically using this connector in order to lookup, edit and report on data within the tables.

## Examples

Please see our [main documentation page on data tables](#) for examples of using data tables as a lookup table and for managing status updates.

These show you how to make use of some key operations:

- Look up row
- Update cell in row

## Notes on using Data tables

### Updating column names

When you first go to access the columns in a table you may find that the actual names aren't present in the output schema:

To fix this you can put a **Terminate** step after the Data tables connector and trigger a run. 

You can then click the 'Use output' button in the debug logs to update the schema:

Once this is remedied you will be able to reference the columns in the subsequent workflow steps:  

### Data tables and Embedded customers

The current version of data tables cannot be accessed from within an end-user solution instance.

### Exporting and Importing projects with data tables

When exporting projects with data tables please remap the data table in the target workspace after importing

### Storage capacity

Please note the following parameters when working with Data tables:

- Character limit per cell: **255**
- Maximum number of rows: **20,000**
- Columns: **8 by default, 16 max**
- Data limit: 5**0 MB**
- Data type: **String **(use text Helpers 'change type' if required) 

### Uploading CSV files

You can import CSV file using **Import CSV** option. 

 CSV files are subject to the storage limits:

The next modal will display information about the uploaded CSV. Please name your data table to complete the process.

### Pasting information

It is possible to copy / paste cells and rows from another spreadsheet directly into your Data table. Such as copying and pasting information from a Google Spreadsheet.

However please be aware of the following before doing so:

- You cannot copy / paste into the column headers - they must be entered individually
- You can only copy one row at a time

### Delete a column

You can delete any column from a data table.
