# Overview

## Overview

MailerLite is a powerful and user-friendly email marketing software service that empowers people of all skill levels to create professional and personalized marketing campaigns.

## Authentication

When using the MailerLite connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the MailerLite connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new MailerLite connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'API Key' credentials.

In order to get this field, first head to your MailerLite [login page](https://app.mailerlite.com/users/login/) and login.

After logging in, click on the icon/button in the upper right corner of the page, then select 'Integrations'.

This will take you to your 'Integrations' page. Find the 'Developer API' tile and click the 'Use' button.

This will take you to your 'Developer API' page. You will now be able to copy your token, by clicking 'Copy'.

Once you have added this field to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in MailerLite's API, which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [MailerLite REST API v2 reference documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/reference), to 

<u>find the exact format</u>

 that MailerLite will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for MailerLite is: `https://api.mailerlite.com/api/v2`

For example, say that the 'List groups' operation did not exist in our MailerLite connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the MailerLite API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/groups`.

More details can be found [here](https://developers.mailerlite.com/reference#groups).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your query parameters are, you can get information about groups that are accessible by you with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/groups`

Query Parameter: Key: `limit` Value: `100`

Body Type: `None`

Final Example outcome being: **https://api.mailerlite.com/api/v2/groups?limit=100**

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the MailerLite connector to list all active subscribers in all your groups.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list your groups.
2. Add Loop collection step to iterate through each group.
3. List all the subscribers for each group, with a 'Subscriber type' of 'Active'.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & list groups

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a MailerLite connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List groups'.

Please feel free to re-name your steps (perhaps after their operational names, as in the demo) as you go along, to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

When run, the workflow will list the groups accessible to you.

### 2 - Loop Collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous MailerLite connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List groups' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field (`$.steps.mailerlite-1.results`, in this example), and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

When run, the workflow will list the groups accessible to you and then simply iterate over each group in the returned list.

### 3 - List group subscribers

The last step is to drag a final MailerLite connector *inside* of the actual Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'List group subscribers'. As you can see, the 'Group ID' field is required.

Use the connector-snake method for auto-generating the jsonpath for the 'Group ID' (`$.steps.loop-1.value.id`, in this example). This time drag your mouse over the previous loop step and select `id` from within the value. Then scroll down in the properties panel, until you reach the 'Subscriber type' input field and select 'Active', from the dropdown list. This is exemplified in the images below:

When run, the workflow will now list all groups accessible to you, iterate over each group in the returned list and list all active subscribers within each group.

The inputs & outputs of each step of the workflow is displayed within your Debug panel.
