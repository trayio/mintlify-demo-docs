# Overview

## Overview

As a data exploration and discovery business intelligence platform, Looker's tool suite allows you to connect live to your data, describe and consolidate usable business definitions, and output/ share results across a variety of endpoints and workflows.

## Authentication

When using the Looker connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

Next, you can add your 'Client ID', 'Client secret' & 'Domain', as shown in the example:

In order to retrieve this information you will need to log into your Looker account (make sure you have Admin level clearance in your account before proceeding).

In ther heading seciton of your account click on the 'Admin' option and within the dropdown list select 'Users':

In the User list (which may be empty if this is your first time adding any) click on the 'Add Users' button.

Create your user as appropriate and click on the new 'Add Users' button as displayed below:

You will be sent to a completion page, press 'Done'.

Head back to the Users page, and you will see your newly created user present. Click 'Edit'.

There will be a long list of information regarding your new user and near the bottom you will see an option called 'APIÂ£ Keys'.

Click though in order to generate the keys needs..

This is where you will find your required information. Copy the keys over to your Tray.io authentication for completion.

Note that in the Tray.io Looker authentication options, that the 'Port' and 'Region' fields are optional parameters that should be added on an either/or basis if your Looker instance configuration is setup to use either one of these.

**REMEMBER** that **'Port' and 'Region' should not both be filled for any authentication**.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Note on Operations usage

The Looker API requires that to add a select group of information to a user, the the relevant endpoint be used to do so. Existing creation operations include:

- Create user email credentials: `/users/{user_id}/credentials_email`
- Create password reset token: `/users/{user_id}/credentials_email/password_reset`
- Create API 3 credentials: `/users/{user_id}/credentials_api3`
- Create two factor login information: `/users/{user_id}/credentials_totp`

All of these operations require an existing user to be present when applying this information to that user.

## Using the Universal Operation ('Raw HTTP request')

As of **v1.1**, it is now possible to effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Looker which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [ Looker v3.1 API documentation](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-reference/v3.1) , to *find the exact format* that Looker will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base url will be automatically set (the base url is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

Assuming that `region` or `port` has not been provided, the base url would look like `https://{{your-domain}}.api.looker.com`.

If `region` has been provided, the base url would look like `https://{{your-domain}}.api.{{your-region}}.looker.com`.

If `port` has been provided, the base url would look like `https://{{your-domain}}.api.looker.com:{{your-port}}`.

> 

For example, say that the `List users` operation did not exist in our Looker connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Looker API docs to find out what the endpoint is and what parameters can be sent [ here](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-reference/v3.1/user#get_all_users) .

From the documentation you can see that the endpoint for listing users would be `/api/3.1/users` and that the method would be `GET`. The input for the raw HTTP request would look like this:

Notice that the documentation specifies parameters such as `page` and `per_page`. This can be used for pagination by adding to the query parameters in the raw HTTP request.

## Example usage

In the following example we create a workflow that gets a list of users, creates an individual user then retrieves that newly created user.

Please see the above section on example usage for list and get account type operations.

1. Create a workflow with a manual trigger and add the Looker connecter with the 'List users' operation.
2. Add the 'Create user' step using the Looker connector.
3. Use the 'Get user' operation to complete setup utilising a final Looker connector.

### 1 - Setup

To begin with, create a workflow with a Manual Trigger, then add a step from the Looker connector with the operation set to 'List users':

We can run our workflow and view our list of users in the output panel of the workflow, as shown in this example:

### 2 - Create User

Next, add another Looker connector step and specify the operation as 'Create user'.

In the input options, set the 'First name' and 'Last name' for our new user.

> 

### 3 - Get User ID

Finally add one more Looker connector to the workflow and set the operation to 'Get user'.

We want to set the 'User ID' to the ID of the newly created user in the previous step. In order to do this without hard coding the answer, we utilise the connector-snake in order to auto-generate a jsonpath as pictured below in this example.

Be sure to click and drag from your input panel (in this case from our User ID) towards the connector step you wish to utilise.

Your result should be something like this:

We can then run the workflow to retrieve the newly created user information:
