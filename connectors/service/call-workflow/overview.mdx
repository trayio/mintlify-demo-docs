# Overview

## Overview

This must always be used in conjunction with a callable trigger. It can be used to send to data from your current workflow to aonther workflow for processing.

It is a very powerful tool for simplifying your workflows and allowing you to work with a 'modular' approach - i.e. multiple workflows can call one workflow which can carry out repetitive processing tasks.

Please see the [Callable Trigger](/connectors/triggers/callable-trigger/) documentation page for a guide on how a Call Workflow / Callable Trigger setup is made.

Note that it is also possible to use the **Fire and wait for response** operation to wait for a reply which includes structured data from the workflow being called. Please see the [Callable response](/connectors/core/callable-workflow-response/) documentation page for instructions.
