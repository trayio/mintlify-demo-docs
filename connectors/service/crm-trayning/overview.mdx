# Overview

## Overview

The CRM Trayning connector is to be used as a part of a training exercise to become familiar with building workflows in tray.io. It replicates a connector that would connect to a real life CRM service, such as Hubspot or Salesforce.

## Authentication

As this is a training connector it does not connect to a real API or service, meaning authentication is not required.

## Note on Operation Usage

All operations in the CRM Trayning connector returns static fake data to be used in the workflow builder training exercises.

### Example

#### List customers

This is an operation that returns a list of fake customers. Please see below for the output sent back from this operation

The above output can then be used in exercises in the Tray Academy which utilize core and helper connectors to achieve given use cases.

The output from these workflow use cases can then be submitted to the [Chat Trayning](/connectors/service/chat-trayning/) connector which will verify the output of the workflows.
