# Overview

## Overview

Hive HR is intuitive, cost effective, user-friendly, data and insight rich, always on an employee engagement platform.

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Hive HR connector, to create an integration mapping between Hive HR and Bamboo HR.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and create a new integration in your account
2. Create a new integration mapping between Hive HR and another external system

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & Create integration

Select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available. From the connectors panel on the left, add a Hive HR connector to your workflow. Set the operation to 'Create integration'.

Make sure to give a 'Name' and select the 'Type' of your integration.

Now when this workflow is run, it will create an integration with the given details.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

### 2 - Create integration mapping

Next, add the second Hive HR connector to the workflow and set your operation to 'Create integration mapping'.

In order to specify the 'Integration ID', start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the Integration ID input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'Create integration' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `id` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

Note that you also need to define the 'User ID' and the 'Foreign ID'.

Now when this workflow is run, it will create an integration mapping with the given details.
