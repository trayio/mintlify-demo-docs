# Overview

## Overview

Aircall is a cloud call center software which enables you to set up a cloud-based call center and integrate with your CRM & Helpdesk software in minutes.

## Authentication

When using the Aircall connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Aircall connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Aircall connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. You will first need to name your authentication and select which type of authentication you wish to set up (personal or organizational). Proceed by clicking 'Next Step'.

On the next page that appears you must choose the scopes that you need dependant on your specific use case.

Once you click 'Create authentication' it will redirect you to login to your Aircall account. Add your login details and grant permission for the scopes selected in the previous screen.

Finally go to back to your authentication field (within the workflow dashboard properties panel from earlier), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 3.0**, it is now possible to effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Aircall which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [ Aircall API Documentation v1.0](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#rest-api) , to 

<u>find the exact format</u>

 that Aircall will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Aircall is: `https://api.aircall.io/v1`.

For example, say that the 'List tags' operation did not exist in our Aircall connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Aircall API docs to find that the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/tags`. More details can be found [ here](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#list-all-tags) .

Optional pagination fields for this endpoint can be found at the following [ webpage](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#pagination) .

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your query parameters are, you can get the list tags information with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/tags`

Query Parameter: Key: `per_page` Value: `20`

Body Type: None

Final Example outcome being: **https://api.aircall.io/v1/tags?per_page=20**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Aircall connector, to list all contacts in you Aircall account and get the information available for each contact listed.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup your trigger and list all contacts in your account.
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each individual contact.
3. Get individual contact details for each.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard (and named said new workflow), select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add an Aircall connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List contacts'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

There are other input fields you can use in order to clarify and be more precise about what type of contacts you are looking to list (by using 'From' and 'Per page' for example), but for the sale of simplicity these fields have been left out of this demo.

When run, this workflow will list all contacts in your Aircall account.

### 2 - Loop Collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Aircall connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List contacts' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `contacts` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

This will enable us to iterate over the list of contacts, and perform operations for each one, during each loop cycle.

### 3 - Get Contact

The last step is to drag an Aircall connector *INSIDE* of the actual Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get contact'. As you can see, the 'Contact ID' field is required.

Use the same connector-snake method for generating the jsonpath to get the 'Contact ID' one by one.

Now when you run your workflow, you will have a list generated and iterated through, with all the relevant information your might need per contact!. See the Debug panel for more details:
