These will give you pre-configured best practice ways of working with BambooHR and integrating it with other connectors.

However, please continue to at least read the Authentication setup instructions on this page to enable you to get started with using BambooHR.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the BambooHR connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your **API Token** and Subdomain.

To generate an API key you need to log in and click your name in the upper right-hand corner of any page. If you have sufficient permission there will be an 'API Keys' option displayed in the menu.

Generate a new API key. Make sure to copy it carefully as viewing it again (for security reasons) will not be possible.

Your subdomain can be found within the first section of your BambooHR URL:

Once you have added these fields to your Tray authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
