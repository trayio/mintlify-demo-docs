# Overview

## Overview

The tray.io HRAnswerLink connector allows you to manage people and sites in HRAnswerLink.

When using the HRAnswerLink connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

**Environment:** (required) Allows you to choose between a production or a sandbox environment. If sandbox is chosen, the connector points to the sandbox API URL.

**UID:** (required) The UID for your OAuth application given to you by Mammoth.

**Secret key:** (required) The Secret Key for your OAuth application given to you by Mammoth.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example

The following workflow has been created using a Manual Trigger and three operations from the HRAnswerLink connector.

Use the **Create affiliate** operation to create an affiliate in your database (note we have switched to the **Debug** tab to view the output):

The **ID** of the created affiliate will be returned in the response as well as the data you have passed in the parameters.

Use the **Create site** operation to create a site in your application, using the **Salesforce ID** and **Affiliate ID** from the above step - this will associate the site to the affiliate:

The **ID** of the created site will be returned in the response as well as the data you have passed in the parameters.

Then in the last step of the workflow create a new user for this affiliate, again using their **Salesforce ID**:

The **ID** of the created user will be returned in the response as well as the data you have passed in the parameters.
