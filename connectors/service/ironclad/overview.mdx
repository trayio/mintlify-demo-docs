# Overview

## Overview

Ironclad is the digital contracting platform that in-house legal teams rely upon to unlock the power of their contracts data. By streamlining contract workflows, from creation and approvals to compliance and insights.

## Authentication

When using the Ironclad connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Ironclad connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Ironclad connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab and 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The Ironclad connector utilises OAuth2 or OAuth2 Client Credentials authentication. 

If you select OAuth2 Client Credentials , the next page asks you for, the 'Environment', 'Client ID', 'Client secret', your 'User ID' and 'User email' credentials. At least one of  'User ID' and 'User email' parameters is required for this authentication type. For OAuth2 , only  'Environment', 'Client ID' and 'Client secret' will be required. The environment can be selected from the drop down.

In order to get your 'User ID' or 'User email', head to your Ironclad dashboard. Click on your account name in the top-right corner, and choose 'Manage my account'.

From this screen, you should be able to see your account email. You will also be able to find your user ID in the URL.

You can also find your 'User ID' and 'User email' by making a 'GET' request to the Ironclad endpoint '**/userinfo**'.

In order to get the 'Client ID' and 'Client secret' , head to your Ironclad dashboard. Click on your account name in the top-right corner, and choose 'Company settings'.

On the next page. Click on 'API' in the left column, You should be able to see your OAuth app in the 'Apps' section. 

From the next screen, you should be able to see the  'Client ID' and 'Client secret' for your respective OAuth app.

Once you have added your details to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Ironclad Trigger

If you wish your workflow to be kicked off by a particular action in Ironclad, you can use the Ironclad Trigger.

The Ironclad trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events associated with the selected trigger operation occur.

### Trigger Operations available:

- Workflow launched
- Workflow updated
- Workflow completed
- Workflow cancelled
- Workflow approval status changed

### Webhook Setup

When creating a new workflow, click the 'Create new workflow' button in the top right hand corner of your main Tray.io dashboard. When the trigger popup window opens, search and select the Ironclad trigger. Wait to be redirected to your new workflow and the workflow dashboard itself.

Follow the instructions above to authenticate your trigger.

As the trigger needs a Webhook setup in order to activate, the first step will be to select the settings icon in the top left corner. Under General settings, you will see an option labelled 'Workflow public URL'. Copy this, press 'Cancel', and head to your Ironclad dashboard.

Then, in the 'Company Settings' section of the Ironclad dashboard, clink on the 'Create Webhook' in the API subheading.

This will result in a 'Create Webhook' pop-up window. Paste the Tray.io 'Workflow public URL' into the 'Target URL' section and under 'Events', select what is relevant to your workflow.

You can test your trigger by performing an action in Ironclad (e.g. Update a workflow) which will trigger your webhook.

**Note:** Before testing your Ironclad-triggered workflow, make sure you have clicked the **Enable** button in the bottom-right corner of the builder screen.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Ironclad which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Ironclad API documentation v1.0](http://developer.ironcladapp.com/) , to **find the exact format** that Ironclad will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Ironclad is: `https://preview.ironcladapp.com/public/api/v1`

For example, say that the 'List workflows' operation did not exist in our Ironclad connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Ironclad API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/workflows`.

More details can be found [here](https://developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/list-all-workflows).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. For this example, we will set the pageSize parameter to 10 to retrieve 10 workflows from the API. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your query parameters are, you can get the list of the first 10 workflows with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/workflows`

Query Parameter: Key: `pageSize` Value: `10`

Body Type : `none`

Final Example outcome being: **https://preview.ironcladapp.com/public/api/v1/workflows?pageSize=10**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Ironclad connector, to get the workflow information.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and and list workflows in your account
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each individual workflow.
3. Gather the information available for each workflow.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List workflows

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Ironclad connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List workflows'.

You will notice that there are a lot of additional configuration fields that you can set on this operation ('Completed', 'Cancelled', 'Last updated', etc). While none of these are mandatory, please feel free to add them according to your project needs.

Please note that the 'Page' and 'Page size' fields are already pre-filled for you, so you need not worry about it at this stage.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

Now when this workflow is run, it will retrieve a list of workflows from the Ironclad API.

### 2 - Add a loop collection

Next, search for the Loop collection connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Ironclad connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List workflows' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `list` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

This will enable us to iterate over the list of workflows, and perform operations for each one, during each loop cycle.

### 3 - Get workflow

The last step is to drag a Ironclad connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get workflow'. As you can see, the 'Workflow ID' field is required. Use the same connector-snake method for generating the JSON path to get the 'Workflow ID'.

Now when this workflow is run, you will be able to gather the information available for each workflow. This means you will be able to view the workflow's details when you click through your debug panel and expand the output.
