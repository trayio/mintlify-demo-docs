# Overview

## Overview

ServiceTitan is for companies who want a cloud-based platform that can help them handle all aspects of field service management, from scheduling to invoicing to sales.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the ServiceTitan connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for several of your ServiceTitan Application credentials:

- **Authorization app**
- **Environment**
- **Client ID**
- **Client secret**
- **App key**

The first item to confirm is the **App key**. This will have been generated when you created your ServiceTitan application. Head to the ServiceTitan developer portal. Make sure you choose the correct environment.

Click on the application you with to integrate with and click under the header **App details** you will find the field **Application Key.** 

After you have copied and pasted your key into the Tray.io authentication model log into your ServiceTitan account. Once more be sure to **select the correct environment**, Integration **or** Production.

Select the **Settings cog** in the top right. In the left hand menu of the main Settings page click **Integrations** -> **API Application Access**. 

Your **Manage API Application Access** screen should open. If your chosen Application isn't present click **Connect New App**. Any existing ones will be listed here.

If the **Application access** field is set to **Access enabled** then your **Client ID** and **Client secret** will be generated.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up modal click the **Create authentication** button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
