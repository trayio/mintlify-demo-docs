# Overview

## Overview

FirstRain is a service connector. FirstRain enables discovery and curation of information that accelerates sales opportunities, helps develop market strategies, facilitates lead generation campaigns and enables risk mitigation.

## Authentication

When using the FirstRain connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the relevant workflow. Once in the workflow dashboard itself, search and drag the FirstRain connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new FirstRain connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window, that should look like this:

As you can see, besides from naming your authentication appropriately, you will need your Authentication key and User ID of your FirstRain account. An authentication key can be generated by following the instructions [ here](https://guide.firstrain.com/api-v2/2017/04/28/authentication/) .

Once you have clicked the 'Add authentication' button, go back to your authentication field (within the workflow dashboard properties panel from earlier), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **v1.0**, it is now possible to effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in FirstRain which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [ FirstRain API documentation](https://guide.firstrain.com/api-v2/category/reference/) **v2.0**, to *find the exact format* that FirstRain will be expecting the endpoint to be passed<br/>in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base url will be automatically set (the base url is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base url is in the format of `https://api.firstrain.com/standard/v2`

For example, say that the 'List buisness graph panel' operation did not exist in our FirstRain connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the FirstRain API docs to find that the 'List business graph panel' endpoint is a get request at the following url:

`https://guide.firstrain.com/api-v2/2017/04/28/buisnesswebgraphpanel/`

So if you know what your endpoint and entity name is, you can get a list of business graph panels, with the following settings:

Endpoint: `/entity/C:{entity}/profile`

E.g. entity: `FacebookInc`

You will also need to add the any query parameters specified in the Api documentation. For this endpoint, you need to send the `panels` query parameter. You can add this as key value pair as below.

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the FirstRain connector, to list who to call/companies to watch channels.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Set up your manual trigger.
2. Add the first FirstRain connector step.

### 1 - Setup trigger

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' on your main Tray.io dashboard (and named said new workflow), select the 'Manual Trigger' from the trigger options available:

Once you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel the left, add an 'FirstRain' connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List call/companies to watch channel'.

*Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.*

Now when this workflow is run, it will retrieve who to call, or the "Companies to watch" channels. You will be able to view this list when you click through your debug panel, and expend the output field:
