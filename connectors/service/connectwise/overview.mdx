# Overview

## Overview

ConnectWise is a business process automation platform that allows your business to sell, service and support technology.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the ConnectWise connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your:

- Company ID
- Company Website
- Public key
- Private key

To get these fields, head to the ConnectWise dashboard.

*[****INCLUDE ****more images and steps as necessary - clearer is always better.]*

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
