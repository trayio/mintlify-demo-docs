# Deprecations

## Google Analytics vs Google Analytics GA4 

Google Analytics are deprecating their old API (v3) in favour of the new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API.

**No re-authentication is required when switching from Google Analytics to Google Analytics (GA4)**.

Workflow migrations will only be required if a you need to create or configure a Google Analytics 4 property. For this you must use GA4.

### Properties

Google Analytics 4 uses a new kind of property, with different reports than what you're used to seeing in Universal Analytics. 

One advantage of a Google Analytics 4 property is that you can use it for a website, an app, or both a website and app together. Whereas Universal Analytics properties only support websites.
