## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Sopheon - ProductX connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Username', 'Password', 'Environment' and 'Workspace ID' credentials.

Your 'Username' and 'Password' will be the same username and password that you use to login to your Sopheon dashboard. Your 'Environment' can be selected from the drop-down menu (almost all users will need to select the 'Production' environment).

To get your 'Workspace ID' head to the Sopheon dashboard. From there, examine the URL in your browser's address bar. Your 'Workspace ID' is the value found between 'workspace/' and the following '/', as highlighted in pink here:

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
