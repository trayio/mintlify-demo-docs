# Overview

## Overview

Ambassador is a platform that automates and scales all your customer referral, affiliate, influencer, and partner marketing programs.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Ambassador connector is **`https://getambassador.com/api/v2/{username}/token/json`**. More information can be found on their main API documentation (v1) - [API Documentation](https://docs.getambassador.com/reference/) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Ambassador connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Authentication' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'API Token', 'Username', and 'Domain' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Ambassador dashboard. Click on the left panel and click on settings 

To get the API Token and username, head to Account Information and then scroll down to API credentials 

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Ambassador Trigger

The Ambassador trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events occur associated with the selected trigger operation.

### Trigger Operations available:

- Webhook

### Webhook Setup

Select the Ambassador trigger. This can be done at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Follow the instructions above to authenticate your trigger. Select 'Webhook' as the event you wish your trigger to listen to in order to set off the workflow itself.

Ensure that you enter values in the format that the API is expecting, especially for fields with string inputs, such as 'Event type' and 'Notification type'.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in Ambassador that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the Ambassador - [API documentation](https://docs.getambassador.com/reference/) v2 to **find the exact format** that Ambassador will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the List Group operation did not exist in our Ambassador connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the

Ambassador API docs to find the relevant endpoint - ***which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/group/all`.***

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://docs.getambassador.com/reference/groupall).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL: **

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Ambassador connector, to get information about a specific Ambassador

The overall logic of the workflow is:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and use the RawHTTP operation to list Ambassadors in your account.
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each individual Ambassador.
3. Gather the information available for each Ambassador.

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:
