# Overview

## Overview

The Tray.io connector for Eventbrite provides access to the Eventbrite API, enabling you to receive data about events you are hosting.

## Authentication

Click "Add Authentication" in the properties panel on the right

In the window that appears, give a name for your authentication, then click "Add authentication":

A pop-up window will then appear, allowing you to sign in, either using your Eventbrite account or using Facebook:

If your login is successful, the pop-up window will close and you will be able to use the Eventbrite connector.

## Note on available operations

The Eventbrite connector currently only supports **Get**, **List**, and **Search** operations; in other words, users can query data, but cannot create, modify, or delete data.
