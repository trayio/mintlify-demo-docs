# Overview

## Overview

Chargebee is the subscription billing and revenue management platform that lets you solve for your today, and scale for your tomorrow.

## Authentication

After adding a Chargebee connector, click to add a new authentication:

You will then be presented with the auth dialog:

When entering your domain be sure to **remove the 'https://' prefix and the 'chargebee.com' suffix**.

So if your domain is https://koreservices-test.chargebee.com you should enter 'koreservices-test'

Your API key is obtained by going to **Configure Chargebee > API Keys and Webhooks** in the Chargebee admin UI:

## Setting up a Webhook

In Chargebee it is possible to set up a webhook in order to **automatically notify a Tray workflow when events occur** in Chargebee.

To do this, **create a new workflow** in Tray with a Webhook Trigger:

In your workflow **click to enable it**.

Then go to **'Workflow settings'** in the top-left of the builder.

From here you can **copy the 'Workflow public URL'**:

And then **create a new Webhook in Chargebee** using the Workflow public URL:

Note that you **can also choose which events to send**.

You can then **test your webhook URL**:

In your **Tray workflow debug panel** you will then see a test webhook payload coming through (don't forget your workflow needs to be enables otherwise it won't work!):

From here you can then use **jsonpaths** such as `$.steps.trigger.body.content.customer.id` and `$.steps.trigger.body.content.customer.email` to grab individual pieces of data from the webhook and pass into other connectors.

For more information please see our [Intro to jsonpaths](/platform/working-with-data/intro-to-data-jsonpaths/) and [working with data and jsonpaths](/platform/working-with-data/basic-data-guide/)
