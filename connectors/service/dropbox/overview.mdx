# Overview

## Overview

Dropbox is a file hosting service which offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and local client software. It is a powerful set of tools for storing and sharing your work and collaborating on projects.

## Authentication

When using the Dropbox connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

You can then enter your Dropbox credentials to link to your account:

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Note on Operations usage

When referencing file paths in Dropbox, you must use the 'absolute' path - i.e. it must begin with a `/` - for example '/test-folder' or '/images/photo.png'

## Example Usage - creating a new marketing project

This short example tutorial will demonstrate the **Create Folder** and **Copy file/folder** operations, and show how Dropbox can be used in conjunction with other services.

It imagines a scenario whereby the first step in creating a new marketing project is initiated by creating a new Slack channel for this project. This kicks off a sequence of events:

1. A new project channel is created by someone in Slack
2. A new project board is auto-created in Trello (could be another project management tool, such as Asana)
3. A new project folder is auto-created in Dropbox
4. A renamed presentation template is automatically copied into the new project folder

The completed workflow looks like this:

The steps involved are:

### 1 - Setup the Slack trigger

When creating the workflow choose Slack as the trigger and create a Slack Authentication.

Then set the Operation to **On Slack Event** and the Event as **Channel created**:

The workflow will then be triggered when you create a new channel:

### 2 - Create Trello project

Create a Trello authentication. Set the Operation to **Create new board**:

You can pick up the name for the project board from the name given to the Slack channel using the `$.steps.trigger.event.channel.name` jsonpath.

When the workflow is triggered, you will see the new project board appear in Trello:

### 3 - Create a new Dropbox folder

Create a Dropbox authentication as explained above.

Set the Operation as **Create folder**:

As with the Trello board, you can pick up the name for the project folder from the name given to the Slack channel using the `$.steps.trigger.event.channel.name` jsonpath (feel free to use the connector-snake to autocomplete this for you).

Note, however, that we are using a trick here to append the project folder name to a top-level 'marketing' folder in Dropbox. We are leaving the **'Path'** box as a String type and 'interpolating' the jsonpath by enclosing it in **{ }**.

Thus the final folder path is `/marketing/{$.steps.trigger.event.channel.name}`

When the workflow is triggered, you will see the new project folder appear in Dropbox:

### 4 - Copy the presentation template

The second Dropbox step assumes that you have some templates available in a 'marketing/templates' folder, and copies a renamed presentation template from there into the newly created project folder.

Set the Operation as **Copy file/folder**:

When the workflow is triggered, you will see the new presentation template appear in the new Dropbox project folder:

### Extra step - checking the new project is marketing

In the above example, it is likely that you will not wish for all new Slack channels to automatically create a Trello board and Dropbox folder.

In this case you can make use of our [Text Helpers](/connectors/helpers/text-helper/) and [Boolean Condition](/connectors/core/boolean-condition/) connectors to check if the new Slack channel contains 'marketing' in the name.

Your workflow will then look like this:

The text helper connector can use the **Contains** operation to check if the name of the Slack channel contains the word 'marketing':

It will return a true/false result which the boolean connector can then check for:

The actions on the **True** path will then only be activated if a channel which contains 'marketing' is created!
