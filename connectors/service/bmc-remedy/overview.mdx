# Overview

## Overview

BMC Remedy is a useful tool for problem & incident management, an easy tool for raising tickets, managing incident changes, & keeping its records.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the BMC Remedy connector.

In the BMC Remedy connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and select the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'Host', 'Username', and 'Password'.

In order to get the 'Host', head to the BMC Remedy dashboard. You can find the Host as part of your dashboard's URL. The URL should be similar to:`https://202104060608590567.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home`. The Host is the hash that comes after `https://`.

In this example, that makes the Host as: `202104060608590567`.

The 'Username' and 'Password' are your BMC Remedy login credentials.

You can also optionally provide the 'Port' and 'Authentication String'. To know more about Ports in BMC Remedy, refer to the document on [Port information](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/itsm91/port-information-608491641.html).

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
