# Trigger

To initiate your workflow based on a specific action in Slack, use the **Slack Trigger**.

The Slack trigger allows you to receive notifications and start workflows when certain events occur that are associated with the selected trigger operation.

## Available Trigger operations:

- On action (button or menu click)
- On Slack event
- On slash command

## Webhook Setup

**Select the Slack Trigger**: You can do this either when creating a new workflow or by updating an existing workflow within the workflow builder.

Select the Slack trigger. This can be done either at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Follow the instructions from the Authentication section to authenticate your trigger. Select the event you want your trigger to listen to in order to kick off the workflow.

## Slack Sub Types

**Note**: The **Also send to channel** option in your Slack messages may not function as expected.

Replies in Slack will trigger a workflow execution via the Slack trigger. However, using the **Also send to channel** feature (replying and posting simultaneously) will not trigger the workflow. This limitation is due to how Slack handles related `sub_types` in their API.
