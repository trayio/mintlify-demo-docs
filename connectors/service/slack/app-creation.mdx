# App Creation

Creating an app within Slack allows you to enhance its functionality, integrate with other tools and services, and tailor it to your specific needs. <br/><br/>You can use Tray to build your own hyper specific Slack integrations with tools like Salesforce, Github, Asana, Dropbox etc. 

Furthermore you can make these multi-service integrations i.e. you can make several services talk to each other via Tray workflows. 

You need to create Slack Apps to utilize features such as Slash commands and interactive modals. These features are key components of automations and advanced interactions within Slack, allowing for more dynamic and tailored user experiences.

Your installed apps can be accessed from the "Apps" section at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar in Slack.
