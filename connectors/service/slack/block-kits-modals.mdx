# Block Kits & Modals

****

**Slack Modals** are a way to present interactive elements and rich content directly within Slack's response to a slash command. They allow you to create custom responses using "blocks" which are Slack sections containing text, buttons, images, and other interactive components.

Some suggestions of when you might want to use Slack Modals are presented below:

- **Interactive Responses: **When you want to provide users with interactive options as a response to a slash command, Slash Block Kits are ideal. For example, you can use buttons to trigger actions, select menus for choices, or date pickers for scheduling tasks.
- **Visual Presentation: **Slash Block Kits let you present information in a structured and visually appealing manner. This is especially useful when displaying data, reports, or survey results in a more user-friendly format.
- **Multi-Step Workflows: **When your slash command requires users to go through multiple steps or input data, Slash Block Kits can guide them through the process smoothly, step by step.

**Slack Block Kits** help you create your Slack Modal via the use of a visual UI tool which updates in real time. It has previously structured elements and templates to choose from which speed up the creation process.

## Create your Modal

### **Set up your Modal**

1. Head to the [Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/T03D4MN7HNV#%7B%22title%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Customer%20Survey%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22submit%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Submit%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22type%22:%22modal%22,%22close%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Cancel%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22blocks%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22divider%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22input%22,%22element%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text_input%22,%22action_id%22:%22plain_text_input-action%22%7D,%22label%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Email%20address%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22input%22,%22element%22:%7B%22type%22:%22radio_buttons%22,%22options%22:%5B%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Yes%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22value%22:%22value-0%22%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22No%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22value%22:%22value-1%22%7D%5D,%22action_id%22:%22radio_buttons-action%22%7D,%22label%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Do%20you%20like%20our%20product?%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D%7D%5D%7D) dashboard. 
2. Select a **Surface** you would like to customize from the **Preview Menu**. Since we are working on a Modal, we have selected **Modal Preview**.<br/>
3. Create a modal using building blocks such as buttons, images, text, etc., available.
4. Send this modal payload to Slack using the **Send to Slack** button.
5. You can now preview your modal in slack using the **Open Modal** button.<br/>

### **Decide which connector to use**

#### Interactive Modal

Building an app **using the Slack Block Kit automatically generates a JSON object**. This means you can copy and paste this object directly into a HTTP connector should you choose to do so.

For example we would use the HTTP connector to run the following `POST https://slack.com/api/views.open` call to open a modal in Slack whenever a `/survey` command was triggered:

- URL: `https://slack.com/api/views.open`
- Header:
- Body Type: `raw`

For a better understanding on how to work with modals using the HTTP client connector refer our more detailed [template](https://tray.io/documentation/templates/sales/interactive-slack-modal-for-creating-sfdc-account-and-opportunity/). 

#### Non Interactive Modal

When you use Slack's **Send message** operation with modals you need only copy and paste the JSON payload into the **Raw blocks** section. 

This way you can **send the modal as a message**.
