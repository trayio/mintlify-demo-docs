# Overview

## Overview

Pipedrive CRM enables businesses to plan their sales activities and monitor deals. It works as an account-management tool with the ability to assist with marketing and the entire sales process.

### Pipedrive Trigger

#### Overview 

Pipedrive trigger allows to react on different action and changes, that was done for your CRM account.

#### Example of Usage

This quick‑start guide walks you through building a Tray.io workflow that listens for **Activity Created** events in Pipedrive and receives the full payload in real time.

## Prerequisites

- A Tray.io account with workspace access.
- A Pipedrive account and API access (admin rights recommended).

---

## 1. Add the Pipedrive Trigger and Authenticate

- Click  N**ew workflow** and choose **From scratch. **
- On step of choosing trigger type choose **Pipedrive trigger**
- Open the **Authentication** tab.
- Choose an existing Pipedrive auth or click **Create new authentication** and follow the OAuth flow.

---

## 2. Define the Trigger Inputs

- Switch to the **Inputs** tab.
- Set **Event action** to **Create**.
- Set **Event object** to **Activity**.

---

## 3. Enable the Trigger

- Click the green **Enable workflow** button in the bottom‑middle.
- The banner will change from *Saved, not enabled* → *Saved & enabled*.

Enabling registers the webhook endpoint with Pipedrive; the workflow is now working.

---

## 4. Create a Test Activity in Pipedrive

- Log in to your Pipedrive account.
- Open **Activities** from the left sidebar and click **+ Activity**.

- Fill in the activity form (subject, dates, owner, etc.) and click **Save**.

---

## 5. Confirm the Trigger Fired

- Return to your workflow and open the **Logs** pane.
- You should see a new successful execution. Select it to inspect the payload – it will include the activity `id`, `subject`, timestamps, and more.

---

## Next Steps

- Add downstream steps (e.g., Slack, Gmail, or logic helpers) to act on the activity details.
- Use the activity `id` to pull additional context such as linked deals or persons.
- Modify the **Event action** or **object** to listen for updates or other Pipedrive entities.
