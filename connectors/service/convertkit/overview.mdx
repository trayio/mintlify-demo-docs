# Overview

## Overview

ConvertKit is a service connector, enabling users to automate their email marketing processes and build their audience more effectively.

## Authentication

When using the ConvertKit connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the ConvertKit connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new ConvertKit connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab followed by 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Organization' or 'Personal').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'API Secret'.

In order to get this field, head to your ConvertKit dashboard. Click on the 'General' menu option under your profile.

To get the 'API Secret' click on 'Show' under 'API Secret' and copy the value.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the ConvertKit connector, to list forms from your account and list subscribers for each form.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list forms
2. Loop through the forms using loop collection
3. List subscriptions for each form

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List Forms

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a ConvertKit connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List forms'.

You have now successfully configured a workflow that gives you a list of forms available in your account.

### 2 - Looping Through Forms with Loop Collection

Next, search for the Loop collection connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous 'List forms' connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'convertkit-1' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `forms` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

With the Loop Collection configured, we can now interact with each of our forms.

### 3 - List Subscriptions for Each Form

The last step is to drag a ConvertKit connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'List subscriptions by form'. As you can see, the 'Form ID' field is required.

Like in the previous step, use the connector-snake and hover it over the 'loop-1' step and select `id`.

To debug at any stage, click on 'Debug' at the top of the page and click on the workflow run you would like to debug.

Now we can list subscriptions for each form that we have on our account.
