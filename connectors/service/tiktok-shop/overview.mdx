# Overview

## Overview

TikTok Shop helps you integrate with TikTok and improve operational efficiency.

## **API Information **

The TikTok Shop connector has the following Base URL: [**https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/api**](https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/api). More information can be found on their main API [documentation site](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/doc/page/63fd743c715d622a338c4e54).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the TikTok Shop connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the '**New authentication'** button.

In the Tray authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your **Service ID**, **App Key**, **App Secret** and **Region** credentials.

To get these fields, head to the TikTok partners dashboard. Click on the App & Service section. If you don't have an app created please do that first more info can be found on the [TikTok partners documentation](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/doc/page/63fd743d715d622a338c4e69).<br/><br/>To get the App Key, App Secret** **click on the app and the details should be available

To get the Service ID copy the last part of the authorization link.

To ensure that the authentication redirects back to please set the app Redirect URL to **https://auth.tray.io/oauth2/token**

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. This should redirect you to the TikTok seller dashboard where you'll need to choose the region & login.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in TikTok Shop that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [TikTok partners ](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/doc)API documentation to **find the exact format** that TikTok Shop will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **'List category rules'** operation did not exist in our TikTok Shop connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the

TikTok partners API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a **GET** request called:** `/products/categories/rules`.**`** **`

More details about this endpoint can be found [here]( https://partner.tiktokshop.com/doc/page/63fd742c715d622a338c4bdd?external_id=63fd742c715d622a338c4bdd#Back%20To%20Top).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL:**
- **Query parameters: **version

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
