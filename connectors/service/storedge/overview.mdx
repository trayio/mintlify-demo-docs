# Overview

## Overview

Storedge is management software for storage facilities that features comprehensive tenant relationship management, embedded tenant communications,  easy-to-use reporting and corporate management tools to provide all-in-one self-storage management software.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Storedge connector is **https://api.storedgefms.com/v1/**. More information can be found on their [main API documentation (v1)](https://api.storedgefms.com/docs/v1.html) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Storedge connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'API Access Key', 'API Access Secret' and 'API Facility ID' credentials.

To get these fields, follow the Storedge [documentation](https://api.storedgefms.com/docs/v1.html) for authenticating the API. 

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
