# Overview

## Overview

Companies use NetSuite REST for enterprise resource planning (ERP) and to manage inventory, track their financials, host e-commerce stores and maintain customer relationship management (CRM) systems. This flexible platform can be applied to a range of business applications.

## **API Information**

The Base URL used for the NetSuite REST connector is **https://{account-id}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com**. More information can be found on their main API documentation (**v1.0**) - [NetSuite REST documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_1540391670.html) site.

## Authentication

### Prerequisites

To use NetSuite REST web services the relevant **REST Web Services and SuiteAnalytics webhook features must be enabled **within your NetSuite account. 

Additionally the REST web services **user must have the required permissions assigned to said user’s** **role**.

If you already have your features and permission setup then please move straight to **Stage 3: **[Creation](https://staging.tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/netsuite/#creation).

### Stage 1: Enable Features

This accordion guides you through the process of **enabling token authentication and SuiteAnalytics** for NetSuite REST API authentication integration with Tray.io.

### Stage 2: Enable Permissions

This accordion guides you through the process of** setting the permissions required** for the respective features enabled in the previous section.

### Stage 3: Create

This section begins and ends in the Tray.io builder so **please have your workflow space set up before continuing**.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Notes on key operations

### Find record

### Create Record

You **must be very precise** **when using this operation**. It is critical that you keep in mind the following points:

- All field references are correctly 'typed' - object / string / boolean, etc
- There are no missing fields
- Any field requirements match the schema

### Execute SuiteQL (advanced query)

You execute SuiteQL queries by sending a `POST` request to the `suiteql resource` and specifying the query in the `request body` after the body parameter "`q`".

Check out the following links for more information:

- [Executing SuiteQL Queries](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157909186990.html)
- [NetSuites SuiteQL Syntax and Examples](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_156257790831.html)

### NetSuite Sales orders

There are 3 main points to be aware of when creating a NetSuite Sales order:

- Your associated NetSuite Role has the correct permissions.
- It is possible to 'use' your item within a sales order.
- The data being sent to NetSuite is being sent in the format it requires.

### Renaming fields

Any fields customers may have renamed within their NetSuite instance **will still display as their native name** **within any of the dropdown options available inside the Tray.io properties panel**.

The NetSuite UI may display your updated field name but what it is referring to in the NetSuite database will not have.

Look for your endpoint in the [REST API Browser](https://system.netsuite.com/help/helpcenter/en_US/APIs/REST_API_Browser/record/v1/2023.1/index.html#/definitions/) and under the **I****nsert record** -> **Request body** select the clickable 'endpoint' link to see a list of **Fields**. This will display the native name for all the field references. 

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 2.0** you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can use if you need an endpoint that is not currently provided.

Please the example below for a full walkthrough.

## NetSuite REST templates

Please note that we have the following NetSuite REST templates available.

These will give you pre-configured best practice ways of working with NetSuite REST and integrating it with other connectors.

## Further Info (REST & SOAP)
