## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Vtiger connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'username' and 'accesskey' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Vtiger dashboard and click on the profile image to reveal a drop down menu. Select 'My Preferences' on the drop down menu.

Your Username and Access key will be listed under the first section.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
