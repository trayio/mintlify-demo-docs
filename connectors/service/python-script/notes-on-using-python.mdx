# Notes on using Python

The Python core connector offers a single operation:

- **Execute Script: **Executes Python code

Although the connector offers just one operation, it's important to consider some key points before using it. 

To grasp the fundamental concepts of the Python script connector, let's examine a scenario whereby data from a Webhook trigger and an Object helper are concatenated.

The workflow is receiving 

- The `itemName `data from the Webhook trigger <br/>`{<br/>    "itemName": "Sauce Labs Backpack"<br/>}`
- The `itemDescription` from the object helper.<br/>`{<br/>    "itemDescription": "carry all the things with the sleek, stream lined Sly Pack that melds uncompromising style with unequaled laptop and tablet protection."<br/>}`

Using the following script the workflow concatenates the data:

Now let's understand the steps involved one by one:

### Building the script

1. **`def executeScript(input): `**The line marks the beginning of a function definition. The function is named `executeScript` and takes one parameter, `input`. <br/><br/>The function's purpose is to process the input data, execute specific operations on it, and subsequently provide the resulting output.
2. **Input variables:** Within the function, the values of the variables `itemName` and `itemDescription` are extracted from the input dictionary using their corresponding keys.
3. **return statement: **The content returned within the script dictates what is accessible for subsequent connector steps to utilize. For example, `return concatenated_string`.
4. In certain scenarios, you may require the use of supported modules in your script, such as `itertools`. <br/><br/>However, there's no need to import them explicitly as this will lead to an error message.<br/>
5. Make sure to indent your code properly. Python uses indentation to define the scope of statements, such as those within loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.<br/><br/>

### Input variables

To access the data provided to the script, we first define variables to hold this data. 

In the example below, we define two variables, `itemName` and `itemDescription`, which will be used to store the data received from the Webhook trigger and object helper, respectively.

By specifying the keys **`itemName`** and **`itemDescription`**, the script retrieves the corresponding values assigned to those keys within the **`input `**dictionary.

`itemName = input["itemName"]<br/>`

`itemDescription = input["itemDescription"]`

## Built-in Feature support

**Python connector's V1.0** supports all of the in-built functionality for [**Python v3.8**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) excluding the following: 

- Python's [Format function](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/string.html) is not permitted as it is not in alignment with the purpose of the connector itself.
- Since only direct scripting is supported with the connector, [Class definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) are not possible.

**Python connector's V2.0** supports all of the in-built functionality for [Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) excluding the following: 

- [aiter()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#aiter)
- [anext()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#anext)
- [breakpoint()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint)
- [compile()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile)
- [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval)
- [exec()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec)
- [globals()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals)
- [help()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help)
- [input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
- [locals()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals)
- [memoryview()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview)
- [property()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property)
- [super()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super)
- [__import__()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__)

## Application Scenarios for Supported Modules

### pprint module

To view the output in the console, users will need to wrap their `pprint` method calls in `print`, as shown in the example below:

The `pprint` module results are sent to `stdout`, which can be invisible to users. 

### itertools module

This example showcases the application of the `filterfalse` method from the `itertools` module, effectively filtering out even numbers from a list ranging from 1 to 10.

### calendar module

This example showcases the application of the `month` method from the `calendar `module. It prints the calendar for March 2024.
