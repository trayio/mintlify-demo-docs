## Overview

The Python connector is a core connector built in order to allow users to add Python functions into their workflows easily and seamlessly.

Using jsonpaths it can use data from previous workflow steps to create variables that can be used in your python script.

Likewise the output from your python script can then be used by subsequent workflow steps.
