# Overview

## Overview

Office365 Management allows users to manage applications, services, data, devices, and users across Microsoft 365 services and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by providing audit activity logs. 

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Office365 Management connector to list current subscriptions and list the available content for each subscription.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and List current subscriptions
2. Add a Loop connector to iterate through the subscriptions found
3. List the available content for each subscription, individually

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List current subscriptions

Select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available.

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add an Office365 Management connector to your workflow. Set the operation to 'List current subscriptions'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

When run, this workflow will list all the current subscriptions under your Microsoft Azure credentials. You can also check the Debug panel for more details on the provided output:

### 2 - Loop and list available content

Next, search for the Loop connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Office365 Management connector step.

In order to specify the list, you want to loop through, start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List current subscriptions' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways, you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

When run, this workflow will iterate through the list of current subscriptions provided by the earlier step.

The last step is to drag an Office365 Management connector **inside** of the Loop step itself. Set the operation to 'List available content'. As you can see, the 'contentType' field is required.

When run, the workflow will now iterate through the list of current subscriptions and list the available content for each one.
