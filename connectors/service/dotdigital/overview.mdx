# Overview

## Overview

Dotdigital enables brands to engage subscribers and customers and drive record ROI through email, SMS, social media, push notifications, and even live chat.

## Authentication

To use the Dotdigital connector, go to your Tray.io account page and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder, search for and drag the Dotdigital connector from the connectors panel (on the left) onto your workflow.

With the new Dotdigital connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click the Authenticate tab and 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'API username', 'API password', and 'Environment' if you want to provide one.

To get these fields, go to your Dotdigital dashboard. You will need to set up your API user.  Expand the User menu at the bottom left and go to Settings > Access > API users.

Select a NEW USER*.*

The username (email address) is automatically generated for you and must not be edited. You can add a description to differentiate between API users, which is useful if you have more than one.

Enter a password and confirm it. Your password must be at least eight characters in length and contain at least one digit or non-alphanumeric character. Please avoid including your email address or company name as part of your password.<br/>For Status, select Enabled.

Then click on the save button.

The 'Environment' field is optional and doesn't need to be entered.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](https://tray.ai/documentation/connectors/service/dotdigital/operations/) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

With the Raw HTTP Request, you can effectively create your operations.

This is a very powerful feature that you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Dotdigital that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [ Dotdigital REST API documentation](https://developer.dotdigital.com/reference/), to find the exact format that Dotdigital will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set. The connector automatically connects to the API to determine your base URL which is based on your region.

The base URL is `https://{{region}}-api.dotmailer.com`, where `{{region}}` is the region that your account belongs to.

The connector automatically retrieves your region information, but if you would also like to retrieve this you can do so via the Dotdigital app. Via the app: Click on the person-and-cog icon in the bottom left corner of the application to produce the settings menu, select Access, and then click on the API users tab. Here you'll find your API endpoint. Only account owners or admin users (users with the 'Can manage account' permission enabled) will have Access available though.

For an example of using the raw HTTP request to create an operation, let's say that the 'List contacts' operation did not exist in our Dotdigital connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the Dotdigital API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/v2/contacts`.

More details can be found [here](https://developer.dotdigital.com/reference/contacts#get-contacts).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. For this example, we will set the `select` parameter to `20` to retrieve 20 contacts from the API. So if you know what your method, endpoint, and details of your query parameters are, you can get the list of all contacts in your account with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/v2/contacts`

Query Parameter: Key: `select` Value: `10`

Body Type: none

The final Example outcome is: **https://r2-api.dotmailer.com/v2/contacts?select=20**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Dotdigital connector, to list address books and retrieve the contacts in each address book.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and retrieve a list of address books in the account
2. Loop through this list of address books
3. Retrieve the list of contacts in each address book

The outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List Address Books

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Dotdigital connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List address books'.

Feel free to rename your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

This step will return the list of addresses in the account.

### 2 - Loop Collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the list of address books found within the previous Dotdigital connector step.

To specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List address books' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

Once you complete this step, it will enable you to loop through the results of the previous step.

### 3 - List Contact in Address Book

The last step is to drag a Dotdigital connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'List contacts in address book'. As you can see, the 'Address book' field is required.

Once again, use the connector snake an hover over the 'Loop Collection' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `id` from the list of output properties displayed.

Once this step is configured, you can run your workflow. The workflow will run through all of the previous steps and retrieve your results.
