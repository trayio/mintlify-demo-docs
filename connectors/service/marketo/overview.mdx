## Authentication

When using the Bizzabo connector for the first time, you need to create a new authentication.

Name your authentication and specify the type ('Personal' or 'Organizational').

The next page asks you for your **API endpoint domain**,** Client ID** and** Client Secret **credentials.

In the main menu at the top of your Marketo account page click on **Admin**.

Under **Integrations** select **Webhooks**. You will have the option to select a previously made webhook if one already exists.

If you choose to make a new one make sure you fill in the details in the following manner including the **Marketo Tokens** you wish to use.

Tokens in Marketo are special strings similar to shortcodes which are replaced by a separate piece of data at run time.

Your **API Endpoint Domain** is located under the **Integrations** menu under **Web Services**. 

The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are located under the **Integrations** menu under **LaunchPoint**. 

Select the service you wish to integrate with in order to find your credentials.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
