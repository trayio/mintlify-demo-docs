# Notes on using Marketo

### Best Practices

Marketo has a [Marketo Integration Best Practices](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/marketo-integration-best-practices/) page which we strongly recommend all users check out before building their Tray.io integrations.

It will help you avoid common pitfalls and make sure you are in line with their service protocols.

### Webhooks

If you are using a Webhook and wish email addresses containing a `+` symbol to be processed e.g. `john.smith+182374@example.com` you will need to change the **Request Token Encoding** from: **None** to **Form/Url**:

### Rate limiting

Your Marketo call limits vary depending on your usage.

- Marketo Instance: R**ate limit of 100 calls per 20 seconds**.
- API-enabled instance:** At least** **10,000 REST API calls per day.**

### Bulk API Endpoints

It is important to note that **Bulk API endpoints are not prefixed with '/rest'** like other endpoints.

If there is a Bulk API endpoint you wish to use that does not yet have an associated operation you can use the [Raw HTTP request](#using-the-raw-http-request-universal-operation) operation to utilise it.

You will need to select `Full URL` from the **URL** parameter within the properties panel.

For example say we wished to poll the job status of a Program Member export. Within the Marketo API documentation the endpoint is given as:

`GET /bulk/v1/program/members/export/${exportId}/status.json`

You would** append this to the first part of the Endpoint URL **(from your Marketo Web Services Admin page) to specify the Full URL. 

Note the omission of  /rest  from the Endpoint URL:

`https://123-ABC-456.mktorest.com/bulk/v1/program/members/export/${exportId}/status.json`

### Get create update lead

This is essentially an **Upsert** operation.

During the first attempt to fetch your lead information Marketo will either update the information should the lead already exist or create a new lead based on said information if it does not.
