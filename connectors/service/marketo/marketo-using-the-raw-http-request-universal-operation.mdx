# Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As ofÂ **version 2.17** you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in Marketo that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the[ Marketo API documentation v1.0](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/) to **find the exact format** that Marketo will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example say that the **List program leads** operation did not exist in our Marketo connector and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the [ Marketo API documentation v1.0](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/) to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a **GET** request called:** /v1/leads/programs/${programId}.json.**

To find your URL you will need to go through your Marketo Admin pages log into your Marketo account and click on **Admin**. Under the Integration menu select **Web Services**.

In the **REST API** **section** you will find your **Endpoint URL **(minus the `/rest` endpoint itself).

**Base URL for Marketo**: `https://${your-base-url}.mktorest.com`

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL: **`https://${your-base-url}.mktorest.com`
- **Headers: **`none`
- **Query parameters: **`none`
- **Body Type: **`raw`

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
