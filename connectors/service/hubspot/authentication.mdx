# Authentication

Within the builder, click on the HubSpot connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

Depending on the Auth type you choose you will be expected to select scopes that are relevant to your project and perhaps an API key. 

**It is critical that you read through the following subheadings** as they include important information on each authentication section which you need to be aware of before you begin  setting up your authentication.
