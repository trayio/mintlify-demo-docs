# Trigger

If you wish your workflow to be kicked off by a particular action in HubSpot you can use the HubSpot Trigger.

The HubSpot trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events occur associated with the selected trigger operation.

## Trigger Operations available:

- Webhook (event subscription) 
- Webhook (custom actions)

## Webhook Setup

Select the HubSpot trigger. This can be done either at the 'create new workflow' stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Highlight the HubSpot trigger. In the HubSpot trigger properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.
