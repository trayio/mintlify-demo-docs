# Notes for Embedded customers

## Developer & CRM Accounts

Embedded users MUST: 

1. Have a Developer account in order to create OAuth applications. 
2. Have a CRM account in order to test as an end user.

You will also need to use said Developer account when creating your authentications. **Otherwise your workflows will not work.**

## Custom OAuth apps

You can create a custom OAuth app in order to [White-label](/embedded/core-topics/whitelabelling/the-config-wizard/) your authentications dialog in during your integrations.

Simply follow the steps outlined below.

### Custom OAuth apps and webhooks

It is possible to configure your custom OAuth app to work with webhooks and the Tray HubSpot trigger.

Having created a Custom OAuth app as above and retrieved your ClientID:

You can then go to the Webhooks section of your app and add a custom Tray webhook url.

Please reach out to your customer success representative to obtain this url.

This will work for any event subscription (not custom actions) - e.g. new contact creation etc.

## Scopes

Please be aware of the following points when dealing with scopes while using an Embedded account:

- **The scopes you use for your source / master workflow are the scopes that your end users will have when creating the auth**. 
- You can also override scopes in the solution editor. This will allow you to specify that **only a subset of the scopes set in the master workflow are available to your End Users**. Please reach out to your Tray technical support if you wish to activate this feature.

- When creating an OAuth app in the Hubspot UI, you shouldn't set granular scopes. This way, you would have to create a custom OAuth app for every integration that you create for this service to enforce scope limitation.
