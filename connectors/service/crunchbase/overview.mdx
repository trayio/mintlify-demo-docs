# Overview

## Overview

Crunchbase is a platform for finding business information about private and public companies.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Crunchbase connector you will need a user key which is emailed to you following registration.

## Using Search operations

The connector has a number of multi purpose operations that allow you to search several endpoints to generate a variety or responses depending on your needs.

As an example we'll look at how you can use the Search Organization endpoint.

### Search for a list of organization summaries

- A basic search operation that will return a list of all organizations on the crunchbase database along with their summaries

### Search for an organization

- Narrow the above search by querying the crunchbase API with a search **query** that could be an alias or a short description
- For example in the below search we query 'alphabet' which returns a list of 8 potential matches including the organization summary of Google's parent company Alphabet

### Search for information on organization

- To get more detailed information on a company and its relationships we can make a GET request by passing in the organizations permalink (a unique identifier that can be found a previous response). The response will include a list of all the organizations relationships capped at 10 per relationship.

- Note that all other inputs must be excluded

### Search for an organization's relationships

- The crunchbase API also makes it possible to filter the relationships that is returned from the API
- To do this under the **Filter** input we need to first select 'Search relationships'
- Then from the drop down you select the relationship(s) for the endpoint you want returned from the API
- Below we search the orgnizations endpoint that returns a response that contains Tray.io's **Founders** relationship
