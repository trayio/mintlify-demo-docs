### Automated Candidate Onboarding

<br/>**Objective:** Streamline the onboarding process for new hires by integrating Greenhouse with HR and IT systems.<br/>

**Steps:**

1. **Trigger: **Use a Greenhouse webhook trigger when a candidate's status changes to "Hired".

5. **Notify IT: **Use the Jira connector to create a ticket for IT to prepare necessary equipment.
6. **Welcome Email: **Use the SendGrid connector to send a personalized welcome email to the new hire.

This integration would require data mapping to ensure information is correctly formatted for each system.

### AI-Powered Candidate Screening

<br/>**Objective:** Enhance the initial screening process using AI to analyze candidate applications.

<br/>**Steps:**

1. **Trigger: **Use the Greenhouse `list_applications `operation on a scheduled basis to fetch new applications.
