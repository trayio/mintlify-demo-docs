# Overview

## Overview

The Act-On connector currently allows you to create, update, delete records as well as query lists and subscription information.

## Authentication

When using the Act-On connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

You can then name your authentication and continue with by pressing `Add authentication`.

This will redirect you to a Act-On login screen. Add your login credentials and press the `Authorize app` button.

If successful, you will be redirected back to your workflow and can now use the Act-On connector.

## Example 1: Creating a record

This example will show how you how to create a record for a list in Act-On.

1. Add the Act-On connector to your workflow

1. Select the 'Create record' operation and the authentication that has been created.

1. Add the ID of the list that you wish to add the record to.

1. To add fields to the record you will need to add properties to the `Record body` object. When adding a property the key represents the field name in Act-On. This has to be exactly as it appears in the Act-On system. If you are not sure what the fields names are, they can be found using the `Get List` operation. The response of the `Get List` contains an array named `headers` which contains all the fields that can be added to the record body.

Below is an example record body that will be created. 

1. Once the record body is ready, the workflow can be run. As can seen below, the creation was a success a new record has been created.
