# Overview

## Overview

Gemini is a suite of AI-powered operations using Google's Gemini API.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Gemini connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your **API Key** credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Gemini dashboard. Navigate to the Google AI Studio found here: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey.

To get the API Key click the **Create API Key** button.

You can then copy the API key from the popup and navigate back to the Tray.io Authentication panel.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example Usage

*[****Reference docs:****  *[*Accelevents*](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/accelevents/)* and *[*Fullstory*](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/fullstory/) *]*

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Gemini connector, to create text embeddings.

The overall logic of the workflow is:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and add a File Helper step
2. Use the **Create file from URL **operation and set the input to a file URL
3. Add a Gemini step and use the **Analyze Image** operation
4. Use a JSON path to the File Helper step output for the **Image File** input
5. Run the workflow to see generated the image analysis

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:
