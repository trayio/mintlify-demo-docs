# Overview

## Overview

Splash's event marketing platform helps companies market, manage, and measure their live, virtual, and hybrid event programs.

## Authentication

When using the Splash connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Splash connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Splash connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'Username', 'Password', 'Client ID' and 'Client secret' credentials. The 'Extra scopes' are optional and dependant on your use case.

The 'Username' and 'Password' fields will be the same as your Splash login credentials.

**To obtain your 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' you will need to contact your Splash Customer Success Manager** as this is not immediately available through your account.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window and ticked the 'User' scope, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Note on Operations usage

Exceeding these rates - either by access token or Client ID - results in a 503 error code.

This limitation is enforced to ensure that all users and clients have a responsive Splash experience.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Splash which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [ Splash API documentation v2.2](https://api-docs.splashthat.com) , to<br/>

<u>find the exact format</u>

 that Splash will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Splash is: `https://api.splashthat.com`

For example, say that the 'List contacts' operation did not exist in our Splash connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Splash API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/Get List Of Contacts`. More details can be found [ here](https://api-docs.splashthat.com/?version=latest#34115d0d-a5e0-4acd-b6e8-94094568461f) .

As you can see there is also the option to include query parameters, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and query parameters are, you can get the first fifty contacts from your contact list with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/contacts`

Query parameters: Key: `limit` : Value: `50`

Final Example outcome: **https://api.splashthat.com/contacts?limit=50**

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Splash connector, to list all your events and retrieve information about them.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list your available events.
2. Use a loop connector to iterate through each event in the list.
3. Retrieve the event details for each of those events.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List Events.

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard (and named your new workflow), select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Splash connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List events'.

You can now list your events. If you wish to be more specific, you can add extra filters such as 'Search', 'Sort', 'Upcoming' etc, but for the sake of simplicity these options have been left out.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

### 2 - Loop through List

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Splash connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List events' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `data` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector.

### 3 - Retrieve Event Details

Finally, add another Splash connector step, within the loop step itself, and set the operation to 'Get event details'.

'Get event details' will require an `Event ID`. Here we can use the connector-snake to auto-populate the jsonpath from the Loop Collection connector, much like in the previous step.

While hovering over the previous 'Loop Collection' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `id` from the list of output properties displayed.

The workflow should now be complete and when run, will display a list of
