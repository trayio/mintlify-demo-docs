## Overview

More information can be found on their main API documentation  - [Pitchly Documentation](https://developers.pitchly.com/client-api/) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Pitchly connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Environment' and 'App Secret' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Pitchly dashboard. Click on the Admins button on the top right of the screen.

To create an API key, click on the API keys option. A pop-up modal will appear at the bottom, click on 'create new key set'

Now you can create your API key with all the permissions you require. 

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
