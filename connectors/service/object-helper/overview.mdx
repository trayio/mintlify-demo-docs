# Overview

## Overview

The Object Helpers connector allows you to **interact with objects more easily and efficiently**, depending on your workflow needs.

Think of it as a 'tidier' way of dealing with data from multiple steps, sources and / or databases. 

It primarily helps users alter their data into a format which subsequent steps can then work with more proficiently.

See our operation summaries below for more ideas and information on your potential data manipulation options.

## Object Helper Templates

Below are some relevant templates you may wish to use or learn from. The full range can be found in our [TemplatesÂ Library](https://tray.io/documentation/templates/).

Templates demonstrate **pre-configured best practices / common use cases** as well as examples of **how to use** this connector and **how best to integrate it** with others.

## Important notes

### Compatible objects

Incompatible objects will not always stop your workflow from running.

Please make sure that your 'object types' are compatible i.e. what your Object Helper is expecting to retrieve. Such as an array of objects vs a single object, or that the formatting of the objects themselves are correct.

## Operations

## Add Key / Value pairs

**Adds** **fields** to a pre-existing object

Or creates a new object from scratch

Then **returns everything** in the form of **a 'new' single object**

## Add Value by Key

Updates the value of a particular field

## Contains

Checks if an object contains a particular field. 

Returns:

- **True** if an object contains your specified field
- **False** if otherwise

## Delete Key / Value pair

Allows you to delete a particular field from an object

## Enforce Object Structure

**Defines a structure** that the object **MUST adhere** to 

**Once confirmed** any **additional fields** from the input are **also included**

## Equals

Allows you to check if two objects are the same.

Returns: 

- **True** if the object **has exactly the same fields and values** as the comparative
- **False **if otherwise

## Find Difference

**Compares** two fields or objects.

Returns:

- **The differences** if there are any
- **Empty** if none** **found

## Get Value by Key

Allows you to retrieve the **value of a particular field**

## Iterative transform

Goes through the fields available and **alters them as requested** (capitalize, camelCase etc.)

## JSON Parse

Takes **JSON code** and **returns it as an object**

## JSON Stringify

Takes an **object and transforms it into a JSON string**

## Map Keys

Allows you to **change** the **field name** referenced **and replace **it **with your preferred name**

## Merge two objects

Allows you to **merge two objects** into one

The **primary object** is the **main point of reference**

## Pick Values by Keys

Allows you to **return a Value** **by** its **reference** **field**

## Properties Exist

This operation **checks** if the fields mentioned exist and returns:

A** list **of** found items**

A **list** of **not found items**

As well as a **True/ False **value for the original query

## Remove Null Values

Allows you to **Delete** any fields with **null** or **empty** values
