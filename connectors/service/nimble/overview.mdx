# Overview

## Overview

Nimble is the next-generation AI-driven Lean/ Agile Work & Project Management solution focused on helping your teams collaborate, manage and deliver their work effectively and efficiently. 

## **API Information **

The Nimble connector has the following Base URL: [https://api.digite.com](https://api.digite.com).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Nimble connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organizational').

The next page asks you for your 'Project ID' credential.

To find your 'Project ID', log in to Nimble and select 'My Workspace from the primary navigation menu on the left-hand side of the page.

Next**, **from the secondary navigation menu at the top of the page,** **hover over 'My Work'  and select 'My Projects'. You will see a list of projects. Select your desired project. 

Now, hover over 'Plan' in the secondary navigation menu and select 'Project Details' to view the 'Project ID'.

Copy or make a note of the 'Project ID' from the Project Details page.

Once you have added the 'Project ID' to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
