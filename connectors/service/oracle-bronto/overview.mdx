# Overview

## Overview

The Oracle Bronto connector allows you to create contacts, fields and mail lists, update contacts, and list various resources.

## Authentication

Before using the Oracle Bronto connector, you will need your **API Key**, which can be created and accessed inside the Bronto web app by navigating to **Settings** > **Platform Settings** > **Data Exchange**.

Once you have a working API key, add an Oracle Bronto step inside a workflow and click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor.

In the window that appears, name your authentication and then add your API Key:

Click 'Add authentication' and you will then be set up and ready to go.

## Filter

For **List** operations, there is a filter object which allows you to filter resources according to particular fields:

In the List operations for the **fields**, **mail lists**, and **segments** resources, there is a 'filter type' which tells the API to only return resources that fulfill all criteria (the **And** type), or just one criterion specified (the **Or** type).

Some filter objects have operator fields, which allow you to be more specific in the filter criteria:

Other filter objects contain just a string; in these cases, the operator is **Equal To** (i.e., return only resources that exactly match the criterion specified):

All filter objects are arrays, meaning that multiple filters on the same field can be specified; for example, you can filter according to multiple email addresses:
