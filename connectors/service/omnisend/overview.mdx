# Overview

## Overview

Omnisend helps eCommerce businesses make their marketing relevant by sending personalised messages to the right person, at the right time, using the right channel. For shoppers, that means tailored messaging and a unique online shopping experience. And for marketers, the power to rise above the promotional noise and get better results.

## Authentication

When using the Omnisend connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow dashboard itself, search and drag the Omnisend connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Omnisend connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. After you named your authentication appropriately, click on the 'Next step'. As you can see, you will need your Omnisend 'API Key'.

In order to get these fields, head to your Omnisend dashboard. Click on your username and then select 'Store settings' from the dropdown menu:

To get the API key, click on 'Integrations & API' and then select 'API keys' from the dropdown menu:

You can find your API keys in the list or you can create a new API key by clicking on 'CREATE API KEY'.

You can create an API key with custom permissions or add new subscribers only permission.

Once you set up your API key permissions, click on 'Save', copy and paste the key from the Omnisend web app into the API key field in the above Tray authentication dialog.

Once you have clicked the 'Add authentication' button, go back to your authentication field (within the workflow dashboard properties panel from earlier), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, it is now possible to effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Omnisend which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Omnisend API v3.0 Documentation](https://api-docs.omnisend.com/v3/overview/intro), to *find the exact format* that Omnisend will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base url will be automatically set (the base url is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

Omnisend base URL: `https://api.omnisend.com/v3/`

For example, say that the 'List categories' operation did not exist in our Omnisend connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Omnisend API docs to find that the 'List categories' endpoint is a get request at the following url:

`/categories`

So you can get the list of categories with the following settings:

'Operation': `Raw HTTP Request (Advanced)`

'Method': `GET`

'URL': `Endpoint`

'Endpoint': `/contacts`

As a result, this will return a list of categories as requested.

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Omnnisend connector, to create a contact and retrieve the contact information by the contact's email address.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup a manual trigger and create a new contact with Omnnisend.
2. Get contact by email address.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup trigger & Create a contact

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' on your main Tray.io dashboard (and named said new workflow), select the Manual Trigger from the trigger options available:

Once you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add an Omnisend connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'Create/update contact'.

*Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.*

Make sure to set the contact 'Identifier' from the list of dropdown options available (this can be email, phone or both). In this example we chose the email identifier option. The other mandatory fields are mandatory are 'Email', 'Status' and 'Status date'.

You will notice that there are a lot of additional configuration fields that you can set on this operation ('Source', 'Send welcome message', 'First name', 'Last name', etc). While none of these are mandatory, please feel free to add them according to your project needs.

Now when this workflow is run, it will create a contact with the given details. You should see your contact's email and ID as a result when you click on your debug panel and expand the output.

### 2 - Get Contact by Email

Once you have added a second Omnisend connector, set the operation to 'List contacts'.

Use the Connector-snake to set the 'Email' using the previous Omnisend connector step, by clicking and dragging on the orange circle mapping icon.

Once you have dragged it over to your first Omnisend step, you will see a dropdown list of options appear. Select `email`. Your output should be similar to: `$.steps.omnisend-1.email`.

Note that you can find contact(s) by 'Status', 'Segment ID' or 'Phone'. Please note that the 'Limit' and 'Offset' fields are already pre-filled for you, so you need not worry about it at this stage.

Now when this workflow is run, it will retrieve the contact from the Omnisend API. This means you will be able to view the contact's details when you click through your debug panel and expand the output.
