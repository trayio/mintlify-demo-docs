# Overview

## Overview

When you are dealing with one or more lists / arrays of data, the List Helpers connector **provides a range of operations to help you manage and manipulate your listed**<u>** **</u>**data as required**.

You can combine data from multiple sources, sort it, extract certain values, find common items, create batches for processing...the "list" goes on!

See our operation summaries below for more ideas and information on your potential list and data manipulation options.

## List Helper Templates

Below are some relevant templates you may wish to use or learn from. The full range can be found in our [Templates Library](https://tray.io/documentation/templates/).

Templates demonstrate **pre-configured best practices / common use cases** as well as examples of **how to use** this connector and **how best to integrate it** with others.

## Important notes

### Your returned items

Note that the List Helper will **always return its results** in the **form of an array INSIDE of an object**.

You will need to form a level of extraction to the results in order play with the array results themselves. 

### Data types

Note you can select a number of type formats whenever you are adding an item to a list.

This is not applicable to every property / operation but is very common and great for multiple use cases.

## Operations

## Add item to list

Allows you to **add an individual item** to a pre-existing list.

Note that the operation doesn't store any data - it just adds to a list and then "forgets" the information. 

## Add multiple items to list

Allows you to **add multiple items** to a pre-existing list

## Chunk

**Creates smaller list sets** from the original.

You will then need to use the [Loop Connector](#) to loop through each batch (which will often need to be sent to a [sub-processing workflow](/platform/processing-data-and-scaling/using-callable-workflows/#processing-large-volumes-of-data) to manage the scale and complexity of your data processing)

## Concatenate

**Joins two lists** together

## Contains

**Checks** your list **for** **specified item**

Returns:

- **True **if found
- **False **if not

## Count items

**Counts** how many items are in your list

## Delete items from list

Allows you to **remove items you specify** from a list 

## Difference

Allows you to **compare two lists **

**Returns** only the **items that do not exist within the second**

## Filter

Allows you to **filter** your list **for items** for **specific values**

## Find object in list

## First

**Returns** the **first item** **found **within your list

## Get item by index

Allows you to **numerically select** the **item you want to return**

## Get list of page numbers

**Divides** your list **into separate pages**

## Get unique items by key

Builds a new list of items based on the Key reference

## Intersection

For **two given lists** this operation **returns** only the** items that exist in BOTH **lists. 

## Iterative transform

Goes through the fields available and **alters them as requested** (capitalize, camelCase etc.)

## Join

**Joins** all the list items into a **singular string**

## Last

**Returns** the **last item** within a list

## Pluck

A **list of values** is created from the item property referenced. Useful for extracting e.g. all email addresses for every contact in a list.

## Remove duplicates

Removes all duplicates from a list. Can be used for removing both simple items and objects

## Rename keys

Updates the name of a particular field

## Reverse

**Reverses** the **order** of a list

## Rotate first item

Puts the **first item** in a list **at the bottom**

## Simple sort

Sorts a list in **ascending** or **descending** order

## Slice

Creates a new list based on a **section of your current list**

## Sort objects

Allows you to put your **items** in **ascending** or **descending **order

## Zip

Takes **two lists and combines them** with key / value pairs created for each item
