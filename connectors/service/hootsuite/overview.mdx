# Overview

## Overview

Hootsuite is the leading social media dashboard allowing you to manage multiple networks and profiles and measure your campaign results.

## Authentication

When using the Hootsuite connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

You will be given the choice of two authentication environments. Choose the 'Default OAuth2.0 App' environment. Ensure you have successfully signed into your Hootsuite account using the pop-up, otherwise operations will not be able to run correctly.

As of version 2.0, the Hootsuite connector now supports the Organization App custom grant authentication.<br/>In this authentication environment, the grant type is set to 'organization_app'.<br/>To authenticate with this authentication environment, again click the 'New Authentication' button in the workflow properties panel.

After naming your authentication and choosing your workspace, you can select either the 'Default' or 'Custom' OAuth2 app environment. Select 'Custom OAuth2.0 App'.

Enter your values for 'Client ID', 'Client Secret', and 'Organization ID'. To get these values, go to your Hootsuite developer portal. Select your app.

You should see the 'REST Client ID' and 'REST Client Secret' fields.

If you do not see these fields, you have not been granted API access by Hootsuite yet. You can request access from Hootsuite, or find more information on finding these credentials [here](https://developer.hootsuite.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-rest-api).<br/>Note that the Organization ID must be for a Hootsuite Organization that has your App installed.
