# Overview

## Overview

The Huddle connector allows you to interact with your Huddle workspace, seamlessly passing documents & folders between Huddle and your other SaaS tools.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the Huddle connector.

In the Huddle connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'Add new authentication' button.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and select the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you to select the "Environment". You can select either "Global" or "US" depending on your account type.

Once you select the "Environment", click on the 'Create authentication' button it will redirect you to login to your Huddle account.

Add your username and password details and grant permission for Tray.io to access the account information.

Once you are signed in successfully into your Huddle account.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Huddle connector, to get a workspace with a given workspace ID.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list all workspace in your account.
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each workspace.
3. Gather the information available for each workspace.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List workspaces

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Huddle connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List worksapces'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

Now when this workflow is run, it will pull down a list of worksapces from your Huddle account.

### 2 - Add a loop collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Huddle connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List worksapces' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `workspaces` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

This will enable us to iterate over the list of worksapces, and perform operations for each one, during each loop cycle.

### 4 - Get a single workspace information

The last step is to drag a Huddle connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get workspace'. As you can see, the 'Workspace ID' field is required.

Use the same connector-snake method for generating the JSON path to get the 'Workspace ID' field.

Once the workflow run, you will be able to gather the information available for each workspace.
