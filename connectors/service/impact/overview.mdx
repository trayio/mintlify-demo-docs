# Overview

## Overview

Impact.com is the world's leading partnership automation solution that discovers, manages, protects, and optimizes all partnership channels to reach actual exponential growth.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Impact.com connector is dynamic: 

`**https://api.impact.com/Advertisers/{account_sid**``}`

More information can be found on their main API documentation - [Impact.com Documentation](https://integrations.impact.com/impact-brand/reference/how-to-structure-requests) site. 

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Impact.com connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** credentials.

You will need to sign up for an [Impact.com](https://impact.com) account.

To get these fields, head to the Impact.com dashboard. Click on the settings menu on the sidebar.

To get the credentials head to the settings page and click on Api Access.

To retrieve the **Account SID** and **Auth Token** head to the Api Access page.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
