## **Overview**

AWS Bedrock is a fully managed service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of building and scaling generative AI applications. 

It provides access to a variety of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, and Stability AI, as well as models developed by Amazon itself.

## Authentication

### AWS Bedrock authentication

When using the AWS Bedrock connector for the first time, you need to create a new authentication.

Name your authentication and specify the type ('Personal' or 'Organizational').

The next page asks you for your AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, and Region.

To learn how to get the AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey refer to the [AWS auth creds](#aws-auth-creds) section. 

For the region field, enter appropriate code for your region. For example, AWS region code for Europe (London), is `eu-west-2`.

Once you have added this field to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the available dropdown options . Your connector authentication setup is now complete.

### AWS auth creds

Follow the below step to create the AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey.

Go to the **IAM service**.

Click on **Users** in the navigation pane.

Click the **Create user** button

Provide a username for the new user.

Attach policies that grant the necessary permissions for AWS Bedrock. This may include policies like `bedrock:*` actions.

Review configurations and click **Create user.**

Once you have created the user you can create the access key using the **Create access key** button.

Select a suitable use case.

Optionally you can set the description, click the **Create access key** button.

Make sure to save the credentials securely or download the .csv file, as this is the only time you can see or save them.
