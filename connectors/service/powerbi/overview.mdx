# Overview

## Overview

Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards

## API Information

The Power BI connector has the following Base URL: **https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation (v1)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/) site. Details regarding their API limitations can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/push-datasets-limitations).

## Authentication

When using the PowerBI connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

The following scopes are required:

- Dataset.ReadWrite.All
- Offline_access

These allow the connector to maintain read/write access to PowerBI datasets.

You can then enter your microsoft account credentials to link to your account:

## Note on Operation usage

The CSV file used in the **Push rows** operation must not contain more than 10,000 rows. If the CSV contains more rows, then you can use [pagination](/platform/standard-best-practices/pagination/intro-to-pagination/) to chunk the data and use the operation multiple times.

## Example - Creating a dataset and pushing data

This example will demonstrate the **Create push dataset** and **Push rows** operation.

In this example we want to import a CSV from Google Drive into PowerBI.

### 1 - Import CSV from Google Drive

Using the Google Drive connector. Set the operation to **Download file**.

Set the **File ID** to the ID of a CSV.

### 2 - Create a PowerBI dataset

Using the PowerBI connector set the operation to **Create push dataset** and enter a name for the **Dataset name**.

To add a table to the dataset, click **add table** and enter a name for the **Table name**.

To add columns to the table, click **add columns** and enter a name and data type for each **Column**. The columns should match the columns from the CSV.

### 3 - Push rows to PowerBI dataset

Using the PowerBI connector set the Operation to **Push rows** and the select the **Dataset Name** and **Table Name**

Set the **CSV File** to the output of the Google Drive connector `$.steps.drive-1.file`

## Example - Adding data from a webhook to PowerBI

This example will demonstrate the **Push rows** operation.

In this example we want to take JSON from a webhook, convert it to CSV and then add it an existing PowerBI dataset.

### 1 - Setup webhook

Set up a webhook following the [Webhook Trigger documentation](/connectors/triggers/webhook-trigger/).

In this example the webhook will receive the following data:

### 2 - Convert to CSV

Using a script helper, set the operation to **Execute Operation**, add a variable called **data** and set the value to the output of the webhook: `$.steps.trigger.body`

Change the script to:

### 3 - Convert to file

Using the file helper, set the operation to **Create File from Content** and set content to the output of the script helper: `$.steps.script-1.result`

### 4 - Push data to PowerBi

Using the PowerBI connector set the Operation to **Push rows** and the select the **Dataset Name** and **Table Name**

Set the **CSV File** to the output of the File helper `$.steps.file-helpers-1.file`

Set the **Headers** to the name of the columns in the dataset. Make sure that they are in the same order as they appear in the CSV, or the data could be set to the wrong column.
