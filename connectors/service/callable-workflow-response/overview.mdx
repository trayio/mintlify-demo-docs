# Overview

## Overview

When using the Tray Platform there will be occasions when you need to send data to a callable workflow, and you wish that workflow to respond - perhaps with a confirmation message, or with some data retrieved via a processing mechanism - before continuing with the main workflow.

The **Callable Workflow response** connector can help you manage these situations.

The steps involved in using callable workflow response are:

1. Create a workflow with a **callable trigger** (operation set to **Trigger and respond**) and a **callable workflow response** step (when using 'Fire and wait for response' this workflow will now be available to select from the drop-down of callable workflows)
2. Create a main workflow which generates data (via interaction with service connectors and core/helper connectors) and pulls the data into a **Call workflow (operation set to 'Fire and wait for response')** step which calls the workflow created in step 1
3. Return to the workflow created in step 1 to configure the processing actions and set the data to be sent back to the main workflow via the **callable workflow response** step

Please see our page on [Using Callable Workflows](#) for more detailed guidance on when to use Callable Workflows, and how to follow best practices.

## Basic setup

## Setting input and output schema to control data structure

In order to make sure that the data being passed between your main and callable workflow adheres to a strict structural format, in the workflow being called you can:

1. Set the **Input Schema** for the **Trigger**. This links back to the main workflow and can force the structure and properties of the data being gathered and passed by the main workflow
2. Set the **Output Schema** for the **Callable Workflow Response** step. This can be used to make sure that you always send back the requisite data to the original workflow, in the correct structure

Taking the above example of customer data, we could imagine a scenario where the data for a **single customer** is being sent and we wish to make sure that only certain data is sent, and only certain data is sent back.

### Setting the input schema

First off, for the **Callable trigger** we can click on **Edit input schema**:

And then add the properties to the schema and set the data type (short-text, array etc.):

Each property has an **Advanced settings** drop-down whereby you can specify that it is 'required':

If you return to the main workflow this will be reflected in the properties panel for the **Call workflow** step:

### Editing input schema and updating dependent workflows

If you edit the input schema you will be presented with a warning saying 'you might affect the following workflows when you apply changes'.

This will also include links to any of the dependent workflows:

You should open any dependent workflows in new tabs and then update them after confirming the new / updated fields in your schema. 

As you can see any new or edited fields will appear in the callable step, with no [jsonpath](#) entered. 

So you will need to map or re-map the jsonpath to ensure your workflow pulls in the necessary data to send to the callable:

### Setting the output schema

Then for the **Callable workflow response** step we can click on **Edit output schema**. In this example it may be that we want to use the customer's email to find their entry in a Google Sheet which has a list of customers' emails and favorite colors.

In this example it is done by pulling in the email from the trigger and using the Google Sheets 'Find row' operation:

Then we can click on **Edit output schema** for the **callable workflow response** step:

And we can use the dialog to set the required data structure to be sent back each time the workflow is called:

As for the input schema each can be set as required using the advanced settings.

Returning to the workflow you can then see that the schema is reflected in the required fields:
