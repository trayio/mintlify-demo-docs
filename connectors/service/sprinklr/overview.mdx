# Overview

## Overview

Sprinklr is* *a unified customer experience management platform that helps companies combine research, marketing and customer service.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Sprinklr connector is **https://api2.sprinklr.com/api/v2 **for production and **https://api2.sprinklr.com/{{env}}/api/v2**  where** env **corresponds to the environments. The environments are Sandbox, Production, Prod0 and Prod2. More information can be found on their [main API documentation(v2.0)](https://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/API_20) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Sprinklr connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'API Key', 'Client Secret' and 'Environment' credentials.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in Sprinklr that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the Sprinklr [API documentation v2.0 ](https://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/API_20)to **find the exact format** that Sprinklr will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **'Read case by case ID'** operation did not exist in our Sprinklr connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the Sprinklr API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a **GET** request called:** `/case/{{case_id}}` **where {{case_id}} corresponds to the actual case id.

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/api_20/case_api/Fetch_Case_by_Case_Id).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** 
- **Headers: **None
- **Query parameters: **None
- **Body Type: **None
