# Overview

## Overview

Amazon Business* *offers business owners access to the retail giant's vast network of suppliers for easy ordering and bulk-volume discounts. It also helps leaders digitise and automate procurement with powerful management controls and analytic tools.

## **API Information **

The Amazon Business connector has a dynamic Base URL based on the region chosen when authenticating. More information can be found on their main API documentation (v1) site. Details regarding their API limitations can be found [here](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-business/docs/document-api-v1-reference-1).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Amaozn Business connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'Client ID', 'Client secret', 'Application ID', 'Access key ID', 'Secret access key' and 'Region' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Amazon Business Developer Central dashboard. 

Under the 'LWA credentials' column, click on 'view' to see your app 'Client ID' and 'Client secret'. You can find your 'Application ID' under the app name in the 

To get your access key ID and secret access key, open the IAM console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.).

On the navigation menu, select 'Users'. Choose your IAM user name (not the check box). Next, open the 'Security credentials' tab, and then choose 'Show'. You can also create a new access key by choosing 'Create access key'.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.

## Available Operations

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/amazon-business/operations/) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in Amazon Business that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will, first of all, need to research the endpoint in the [Amazon Business ](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-business/docs/document-api-v1-reference-1)API documentation v1 to **find the exact format** that Amazon Business will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the `Get report` operation did not exist in our Amazon Business connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the Amazon Business API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called:** **`/reports/2021-09-30/reports/{reportId}.``** **`

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-business/docs/document-api-v1-reference-1#get-reports2021-09-30reportsreportid).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL: **
- **Body Type: **none

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
