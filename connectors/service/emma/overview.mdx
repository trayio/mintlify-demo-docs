# Overview

## Overview

Emma gives you all the tools you need to send out email campaigns that really connect with your subscribers.

## Authentication

When using the Emma connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Emma connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Emma connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'Account ID', 'Public API key' and 'Private API key' credentials.

In order to get these fields, log on to your emma account. Once logged in, go to your Account page by clicking your Name (beside the ? icon) at the navigation menu.

On the Account page, click the the API key to generate your keys for the first time.

Click the Generate API Key. **Copy the Public key, Private key and Account ID and save it somewhere else**. The reason for recording these credentials is simply because the **Private keys are only displayed when initially generated**.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in Emma which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [Emma API documentation v1.0](https://api.myemma.com/index.html), to 

<u>find the exact format</u>

 that Emma will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for Emma is: `https://api.e2ma.net/[[account_id]]`

For example, say that the 'List Members' operation did not exist in our Emma connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint, you would use the Emma API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/groups`.

More details can be found [here](https://api.myemma.com/api/external/members.html?highlight=members#get--#account_id-members).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your query parameters are, you can get the members information with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `/members`

Query Parameter: Key: `deleted` Value: `true`

Body Type : `none`

Final Example outcome being: **https://api.e2ma.net/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/members?deleted=true**

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Emma connector, to get the member information for a specific email address.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and list all members in your account.
2. Add the Loop collection connector to iterate over each individual member.
3. Gather the information available for each member.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List members

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Emma connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List members'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

Now when this workflow is run, it will pull down a list of members from the Emma API.

### 2 - Add a loop collection

Next, search for the 'Loop collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Emma connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List members' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

*For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.*

This will enable us to iterate over the list of members, and perform operations for each one, during each loop cycle.

### 4 - Get member by email

The last step is to drag an Emma connector *INSIDE* of the actual Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get member by email'. As you can see, the 'Email' field is required. Use the same connector-snake method for generating the JSON path to get the 'Email' field.

Once the workflow run, you will be able to gather the information available for each member.
