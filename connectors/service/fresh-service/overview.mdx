# Overview

## Overview

Freshservice is a cloud-based IT Help Desk and service management solution that enables organizations to simplify their IT operations. The solution offers features that include a ticketing system, self-service portal, and knowledge-base.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the FreshService connector.

In the FreshService connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'New authentication' button. This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal.

Name the authentication something that will easily identify it in a larger list. For example using the name of the service account, whether it is a Sandbox or Production OAuth, etc.

When choosing between the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational'), consider who and how many people will need access to it.

The next page asks you for your 'Access token' and 'Domain' credentials.

To get the 'Domain', head to your FreshService account and sign in. Select the URL of the FreshService account.

The URL will be similar to: `https://trayio-org.myfreshservice.com/crm/sales/`.

The Domain is the hash between `https://` and `.myfreshservice.com`.

In this case, the **Domain** is: `trayio-org`.

To get the 'API key' on your FreshService account, click on your profile picture on the top right corner of your portal. Go to the 'Profile Settings' page.

Your API key will be available below the 'Delegate Approvals' section to your right.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the FreshService connector, to create tickets and then send notifications for the newly created tickets on chosen Slack channel.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a Webhook trigger and fetch data.
2. Loop through the fetched data using a Loop connector.
3. Create tickets in Freshservice based on the looped data.
4. Send messages on the selected Slack channel for the newly created tickets.

The following workflow demonstrates one approach to achieving this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger

Setup using a trigger (Webhook in this case) to fetch the data.

The data received through the Webhook trigger is in JSON format:

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

### 2 - Loop fetched data and create tickets

**Loop** is set to 'Loop List' the data received from the trigger.

A jsonpath for the 'List' field should appear similar to this: `$.steps.trigger.body`. You can always use a connector-snake to find the jsonpath.

The final message sent on the Slack channel would look like this:
