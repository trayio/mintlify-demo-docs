# Overview

## Overview

KROW is* *a workflow automation tool for recruiters that features mobile apply for candidates, automated candidate screening, automated interview scheduling, hire and reject SMS scheduling.

## **API Information **

The KROW trigger has the following Base URL: **'https://api.{{environment}}.krow.ai/v1**. Where {{environment}} corresponds to the environment which can be `**dev**`** **for development, `**int**`**Â **for integration testing, `**next**` for production, and `**stg**` for staging. 

## KROW Trigger

The KROW trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events occur associated with the selected trigger operation.

### Trigger Operations available:

- Webhook

### Webhook Setup

Select the KROW trigger. This can be done at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Highlight the KROW trigger. In the KROW trigger properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the **Create new authentication** button.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal. The first page will ask you to name your authentication and select the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your 'API Key' and 'Environment' credentials.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button to authenticate your trigger. Select 'Webhook' as the event you wish your trigger to listen to in order to set off the workflow itself.

Make sure to also specify the 'Event' you want the webhook to listen out for and respond to. In this example, the events that can be selected are **'applicant.hired'**, **'applicant.created'**, **'opening.created**', **'opening.updated'**. Now, when the workflow is enabled (in the account the trigger is authenticated to), a webhook will be sent and this workflow will be triggered.
