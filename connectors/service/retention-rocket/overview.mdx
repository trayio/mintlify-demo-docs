# Overview

## Overview

Retention Rocket makes retention marketing simpler and more profitable for leading eCommerce retailers.

## Authentication

When using the Retention Rocket connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow dashboard itself, search and drag the Retention Rocket connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

Once signed into your Retention Rocket account, click on the "Create new" option within "Acquisition" drop-down menu, and choose "Form Builder" from the dashboard options.

Many of the options will be pre-filled for you, so you can either use the test data given or update as pre your preference. Once you have created your Form builder campaign, click the "Save Campaign" button at the bottom of the page followed by the new "Done" option.

Now you can see the name of your campaign in "Current List Builders".
