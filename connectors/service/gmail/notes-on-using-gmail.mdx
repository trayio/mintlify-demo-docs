# Notes on using Gmail

### Sending one email to multiple inboxes

There may be an occasion where you will wish to send one email to multiple email addresses. 

In this use case you have three options to choose from. You **don't need to know the exact number of email addresses you will need to send your email to**, for any of them before setting up.

This is based on the fact that the list of multiple email addresses you create will be **returned as an array** and array can be populated with one or several items.

Your options are as follows:

1. **Via the Property Panel**: Pass the data direct to the highest property of the properties panel - as long as you format the data correctly.
2. **Use Connector Helpers**: If you pass an array to either of them then they will return a string version of the listed email address.
3. **JSONata**: Solution:

### Downloading file attachments

If you want to download an attachment from an email note that the download will get saved in a file format

You will need to use the [File helper](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/helpers/file-helper/) to download the attachment properly (and in the desired format).

### List threads

The operation returns the thread ID, which can be used for various other operations. For instance, the thread ID can be utilized to receive notifications when a message is added to a particular thread, using the Gmail trigger's Thread Message operation.

The List thread operation returns a list of all conversation threads in your Gmail inbox. 

You can filter the list using the Query parameter in the properties panel.

In the below example we have filtered the thread for the emails with subject line as `Product_delivery_details.`

As a result the operation returns the thread ID, which can be used for various other operations. 

For instance, the thread ID can be utilized to receive notifications when a message is added to a particular thread, using the [Gmail trigger's Thread Message operation](https://tray.io/documentation/connectors/service/gmail/gmail-trigger/#thread-message-notification).

## Example 1 - Sending an email

This example will walkthrough how to send an email using the Gmail connector.

The first step is to select the `Send email` operation.

Here, a subject and an email body has been defined. This has been done using the `subject` and `body` input fields.

The next step is to configure the address that will be sending the email, and the address that will be receiving the email.

The email is now ready to be sent. To do so, the workflow is ran and as can be seen it has been successful in sending the email.
