# Overview

## Overview

Use the Tray Gmail connector to list, send and download emails as well as change system preferences.

## API Information

The Gmail connector has the following Base URL: **https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation (v1)](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) site. Details regarding their API limitations can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/quota).

## Authentication

Once this is done, click the **Create new authentication** button:

Name your authentication and specify the type ('Personal' or 'Organizational').

The next page will prompt you to enter your **Service account email**, **Private key** and **Subject email. ** These fields are required only if you are using the **Send-as Alias** operation in the Gmail connector.

Next, ensure you set appropriate Service Permissions for your project scopes and then click **Create Authentication**.

Once redirected to Google, click on the **Allow** button to permit Tray to access your Google account.

Once done go back to your authentication field (within the workflow dashboard properties panel from earlier), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

This should validate and you will now be authenticated.
