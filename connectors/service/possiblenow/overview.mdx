# Overview

## Overview

PossibleNow brings strategic thinking and expertise around zero-party data.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the possiblenow connector is **https://pmstg.mypreferences.com/Profiles**. More information can be found on their main [PossibleNow API](https://pmstg.mypreferences.com/Profiles/Help) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the possiblenow connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your '**Client name**' and '**User ID**'  and '**Key**' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the possiblenow dashboard. Click on the user profile dropdown on the top right.

You should be able to acquire the **Client name** from the above section. The **User ID **should be the same as you login user name.

To get the key please contact PossibleNOW support.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version V.1**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in  that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [PossibleNow API](https://pmstg.mypreferences.com/Profiles/Help) API documentation v1 to **find the exact format** that possiblenow will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **'Get AddressTypes'** operation did not exist in our possiblenow connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the

possiblenow API docs to find the relevant endpoint - ***which in this case is a ***`**GET**`*** request called: ***`/{clientId}/AddressTypes`***.***

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://pmstg.mypreferences.com/Profiles/swagger/ui/index#!/Config/Config_GetAddressTypes ).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL: **

- **Body Type: **`None`

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
