# Overview

## Overview

Google Meet is a *s*ecure video conferencing for everyone to connect, collaborate, and celebrate from anywhere in the world.

## **API Information **

More information on the Google Meet API can be found on the [Google Meet documentation site](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2) 

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Google Meet connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

You will then be able to select the required scopes before completing your authentication with your Google Account credentials:

Once you have added the scopes to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
