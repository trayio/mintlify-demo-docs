# Overview

## Overview

A workflow with a Manual Trigger will only run when you click the 'Run Workflow Now' button:

This is useful for when you have automated processes which only need to be kicked off exactly when you say - i.e. they are not scheduled, nor are they dependent on receiving input from other services.

An example would be for a data transfer operation which is either is a one-off, or only needs to be run when needed.

The Manual Trigger is also very useful for setting up test workflows. It is very handy for triggering a workflow run, before checking the [logs](/platform/getting-started/logs-and-troubleshooting/) to see if it has worked and inspect the output results.
