# Overview

## Overview

Dynamics GP is a business management solution offering a range of Functionality to automate and streamline business processes. Manage your finances, projects, HR, supply chain, and CRM. Make better data-driven decisions with business intelligence capabilities.

## Authentication

When using the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow builder itself, search and drag the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Microsoft Dynamics GP connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on the Authenticate tab and 'Add new authentication' (located under the 'Authentication' field).

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. The first page will ask you to name your authentication, and state which type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organization').

As you can see, the next page asks you for your 'WSDL URL', 'Username', and 'Password'. Scrolling down, you can also provide 'Domain' and 'Workgroup'.

The WSDL URL that you will provide here will be slightly different depending on whether you are using the Legacy endpoint or the Native endpoint:

- **Legacy endpoint**: `http://server_name:port/DynamicsGPWebServices?singleWsdl`
- **Native endpoint**: `http://server_name:port/Dynamics/GPService?singleWsdl`

Substitute the server name and the port selected during installation for the 'server_name' and 'port' in the above URLs.

The values for the other fields will be as they were set when 'Web Services for Microsoft Dynamics GP' was installed.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication popup window, click on the 'Create authentication' button. Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Note on Operations Usage

### List sales orders

This operation calls the GetSalesOrderList method, and unlike other List operations, can fail unless a 'Criteria' is specified.

#### 'List sales orders' fails without criteria

#### 'List sales orders' criteria workaround

<br/>A possible workaround is to specify a criteria such as Customer ID Not Equal Value empty string, as shown in this example of a successful request.

You can send an empty string by typing some value into the field, clicking outside the field to set the value, deleting it and finally clicking outside of the field to set an empty string.

### Context

With two exceptions, all of the Web Service methods require a 'Context'. For example, setting the 'Organization key' to the Company 'Id' of 7:

The exceptions are the GetCompanyList method (represented by the 'List companies' operation) and the GetWSEnabledCompanyList method (represented by the 'List companies (Web services enabled)' operation). These two operations fail if supplied with such a 'Context'.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector, to loop through a list of Customers and return full data of each one.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Create a new workflow using a manual trigger
2. Add a 'Microsoft Dynamics GP' connector step and set up the 'List customers' operation
3. Add a 'Loop Collection' connector step and set up the 'Loop list' operation to iterate through the list of customers
4. Add a 'Microsoft Dynamics GP' connector step and set up the 'Get customer' operation to retrieve the full data of each customer

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Create new workflow using a manual trigger

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After clicking 'Create workflow' you will be redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard.

You are now ready to begin building your workflow.

### 2 - Set up 'List customers' operation

From the connectors panel on the left, add a 'Microsoft Dynamics GP' connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List customers'.

A 'Context' is required, and has been defined as described above (see [Context](#context)).

Feel free to rename your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.

This part is optional but some filter parameters have been applied to this List operation to reduce the number of results it returns.

### 3 - Set up 'Loop list' operation

Next, search for the 'Loop Collection' connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The 'Loop Collection' connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous 'Microsoft Dynamics GP' connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the 'List' mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List customer' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select the array of results `CustomerSummary` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your 'List' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

### 4 - Set up 'Get customer' operation to retrieve full data of each customer

The last step is to drag a 'Microsoft Dynamics GP' connector **inside** of the 'Loop Collection' step itself. Set the operation to 'Get customer'. As you can see, within the 'Key' input the 'ID' field is required.

In order to specify this ID, start by using the 'ID' mapping icon (found next to the 'ID' input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake. While hovering over the 'Loop Collection' connector, select the `Id` within `Key` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within the 'ID' input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

Running the workflow will loop through the collection of results returned by the 'List customers' operation, retrieve the full data of each result.
