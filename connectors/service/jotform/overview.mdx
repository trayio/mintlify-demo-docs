# Overview

## Overview

JotForm is an online form-building service. Users can create forms from scratch using the drag-and-drop building tool, or select from one of over 7,000 templates.

## Authentication

Within the workflow builder, highlight the JotForm connector.

In the JotForm connector properties panel to the right of the builder, click on the Authenticate tab and the 'New authentication' button. This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up modal.

Name the authentication something that will easily identify it in a larger list. For example using the name of the service account, whether it is a Sandbox or Production OAuth, etc.

When choosing between the type of authentication you wish to create ('Personal' or 'Organisational'), consider who and how many people will need access to it.

The second page asks you for your 'API Key' and 'URL'.

In order to get these fields, head to the JotForm dashboard. Hover over your profile icon in the top right corner of the page and a menu should appear where you can click 'settings' to take you to your account page.

From your account page, select 'API' from the left-hand side panel. If you already have an API key, it will now appear in the middle of your screen. If not, click the 'Create New Key' button and a new API key will appear. If you want to be able to perform create, delete or update operations, select 'full access' from the permissions menu next to the API key.

Copy the API Key and head back over to your Tray.io builder. Paste the key into the 'API Key' field on the authentication pop-up.

There are two options for the 'URL' field, i.e., 'Region' and 'Custom host'.

Most users may need to select 'Region' as an option. Once selected, you can choose a value from the available drop-down options for the 'Region' field. The appropriate region selection depends on the JotForm dashboard URl that appears in your browser's address bar if the URL begins with 'jotform.com', then select `api` as Region. If, the URl begins with 'eu-jotform.com', select `eu-api` as Region.

If JotForm has provided you with a custom host and the URL that appears in your browser begins with neither 'jotform.com', nor 'eu-jotform.com', then select 'Custom host' and enter the custom host address provided by JotForm.

Once you have added the 'API Key' and 'URL' fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.

Go back to your settings authentication field (within the workflow builder properties panel), and select the recently added authentication from the drop-down options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## JotForm Trigger

If you wish your workflow to be kicked off by a particular action in JotForm, you can use the JotForm Trigger.

The JotForm trigger allows you to receive notifications and trigger workflows when given events occur associated with the selected trigger operation.

### Trigger Operations available:

- On webhook

### Webhook Setup

Select the JotForm trigger. This can be done either at the create new workflow stage or updated within the workflow builder itself.

Highlight the JotForm trigger. In the JotForm trigger properties panel to the right of the builder, either select an existing authentication or follow the steps described in the [Authentication](#authentication) section above to create a new authentication.

Select 'Webhook' as the event you wish your trigger to listen to in order to set off the workflow itself. As an input you will need to select a 'Form ID' from the drop-down menu, or you can enter one manually.

Finally, click the **Enable** button in the bottom-right corner of the builder screen to activate your workflow.

Now, whenever an action is performed on the selected form, your workflow will run.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version X3.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a very powerful feature which you can put to use when there is an endpoint in JotForm which is not used by any of our operations.

To use this you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [JotForm API documentation v1.0](https://api.jotform.com/docs/), to **find the exact format** that JotForm will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

Note that you will only need to add the suffix to the endpoint, as the base URL will be automatically set (the base URL is picked up from the value you entered when you created your authentication).

The base URL for JotForm will be either `https://eu-api.jotform.com` or `https://api.jotform.com`

For example, say that the 'List forms' operation did not exist in our JotForm connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the JotForm API docs to find the relevant endpoint - which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/user/forms`.

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://api.jotform.com/docs/#user-forms).

As you can see there is also the option to include a query parameter, should you wish to do so. So if you know what your method, endpoint and details of your query parameters are, you can list forms with the following settings:

Method: `GET`

Endpoint: `XXXXXX`

Query Parameter:

- Key: `offset` Value: `0`
- Key: `limit` Value: `20`

Final outcome being: **<Content type link TBD>**

## Example Usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the JotForm connector, to list all the forms from the JotForm account and then loop through the list, retrieving the details of each form on the list.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a JotForm trigger and list forms operation.
2. Loop through the list of forms.
3. Retrieve the details of each form.

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List Forms

Setup your JotForm trigger and select the appropriate 'Form ID'. To learn in detail how to set up a JotForm trigger refer to the [Webhook Setup](#webhook-setup) section above.

With your trigger in place, add a JotForm connector. Set the operation to 'List forms'.

As you can see, the 'offset' and 'limit' fields are required. Either leave the default values as they are or enter appropriate values as per your requirements.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

This first step will list all the forms from the JotForm account.

### 2 - Loop through the list of forms

Next, search for the Loop connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operation to 'Loop List'.

The Loop connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous JotForm connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List' field in the 'List forms' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `content` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

Once this step has been completed, you will be able to loop through the list of forms you retrieved in **List forms** step.

### 3 - Get Form

The last step is to drag a JotForm connector **inside** the Loop connector step itself. Set the operation to 'Get form'. As you can see, the 'Form ID' field is required. This can be obtained by using the connector snake once again to hover over the 'Loop' step and selecting `value.id` from the list of output properties displayed.

With this last step completed, you will have successfully retrieved the details of every form associated with your JotForm account.

You can always inspect the [logs of your workflow](/platform/troubleshooting/logs-and-debugging/) by using the ‘Debug’ tab available on the top of the Tray builder.

If you go through each execution of the 'Get form' step, you will see the results of each loop.
