# Overview

## Overview

The Walmart Marketplace connector helps to generate applications for managing items, orders, prices, promotions, inventory, and reports on Walmart.com

## Authentication

When using the Walmart Marketplace connector, the first thing you will need to do is go to your Tray.io account page, and select the workflow you wish to work on. Once in the workflow dashboard itself, search and drag the Walmart Marketplace connector from the connectors panel (on the left hand side) onto your workflow.

With the new Walmart Marketplace connector step highlighted, in the properties panel on the right, click on 'New Authentication' which is located under the 'Settings' heading.

This will result in a Tray.io authentication pop-up window. First name your authentication and choose your authentication type.

On the next page you will need to provide your 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret', plus select the relevant environment.

> 

To retrieve both your 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' navigate to the the API keys page within your Walmart Marketplace account.

*For further details on how to retrieve this information please contact your Walmart customer service representative.*

Once you have both keys, copy and paste them into the Tray.io authentication window.

Once you have clicked the 'Create authentication' button, go to back to your authentication field (within the workflow dashboard properties panel from earlier), and select the recently added authentication from the dropdown options now available.

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Example usage

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Walmart Marketplace connector to acknowledge released orders.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup your trigger and gather a list of released orders.
2. Loop through said list, and note each one individually.
3. Acknowledge each order within the collection.

The final outcome should look like this:

### 1 - Setup trigger & List Released Orders

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' on your main Tray.io dashboard (and named said new workflow), select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

After you have been redirected to the Tray.io workflow dashboard, from the connectors panel on the left, add a Walmart Marketplace connector to your second step. Set the operation to 'List released orders'.

This operation has 2 required properties that need to be set in order to filter results by range: 'Created start date' and 'Created end date'.

The rest of the properties are optional, and dependant on your project needs.

*Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users.*

When run, this workflow will list 10 released orders associated with your Walmart Marketplace account.

### 2 - Loop Collection

The Loop Collection allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through each released order, that was returned by the previous step.

Search for 'Loop collection' in your connectors panel and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

Here you will need to specify the list you want to loop through, using the 'List' input field. Use the connector-snake to assign this field to the `order` array, that is produced by the 'List released orders' step:

When run, this workflow will iterate through the list of released orders provided. However, at the moment it doesn't do anything with that list.

### 3 - Acknowledge Orders

We are now going to use the Loop Collection to acknowledge each released order.

First, add a new Walmart Marketplace connector step *INSIDE* of the Loop Collection step. Set the operation to 'Acknowledge orders'.

Next, configure it with the right 'Purchase order ID'. Use the connector-snake once more to assign the 'Purchase order ID' field to the `purchaseOrderId` value output, which is generated by the Loop Collection step.

Now, when this workflow is run, it will first list every released order, and then for each individual released order, it will acknowledge the order.

You should be able to see the data for each order within your Debug panel:
