# Overview

## Overview

Google Chat is an intelligent and secure communication and collaboration tool, built for teams.

## **API Information **

The Google chat connector has the following Base URL: **https://chat.googleapis.com/v1**. More information can be found on their main API [documentation (v1)](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Google chat connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

You will then be able to select the required scopes before completing your authentication with your Google Account credentials:

Once you have added the scopes to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
