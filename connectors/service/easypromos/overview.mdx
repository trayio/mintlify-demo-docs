# Overview

## Overview

Easypromos is a leader in digital promotions offering a self-service, easy-to-use platform to create and manage digital campaigns seamlessly across any social media network or device.

## Authentication

To create an authentication with Easypromos log in to the Easypromos app and go to the Developers section found in the Utilities dropdown menu. Then click Create new token to create a new token. Use this key when creating your authentication within Tray.

One point to note about Easypromos tokens is that when created, they expire in 30 days. You can extend this expiration date by clicking on the Pencil icon and choosing from one of the options they provide in the Extend by dropdown. Once the time extension is chosen, click on the Save button to confirm these changes.

We recommend that you use the Check token is valid operation to ensure that your token has not expired. This operation returns false if the Token is not valid. Using an invalid token with any other operation will cause the operation to fail. By using Check token is valid you can safely determine the validity of the current Token and take action if it is no longer valid.
