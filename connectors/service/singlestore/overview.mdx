# Overview

## Overview

SingleStore is a proprietary, cloud-native database designed for data-intensive applications.

## **API Information **

The connector uses the host URL which is provided at the point of creating authentication as its base URL More information can be found on their main API documentation (v8.2) [site](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/data-api/access-the-data-api/). Details regarding their API limitations can be found [here](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/configuration-reference/system-limits/).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the SingleStore connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the **Auth** tab and click on the **New authentication** button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal name your authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' vs 'Organisational').

The next page asks you for your **Username**, **Password**, and **Host** credentials.

To get these fields, head to the SingleStore dashboard. On the left tab, you will find a button labeled "Create New Workspace Group." Click on this button. 

This action should take you to a new screen or form where you can fill in the required fields to create a new workspace group. Complete the necessary information in the form to create your new workspace group.

After clicking the "Create New Workspace Group" button, you will be redirected to a new page where you can create a new workspace group. 

On this page, you will be prompted to create a new workspace within the workspace group you just created.

It's worth noting that the Username is always "**Admin". **Return to the main dashboard. On the left panel, select the "Cloud" tab. Click on the specific group you are interested in.

Inside the group, click on "Workspaces". Locate your workspace in the list of workspaces. On the right, click on the triple dots (ellipsis) to open a menu. From the menu, select "Connect directly." 

In the new popup, you will find a password that has been automatically generated for you. Just below the password, there should be an option to select "CLI Client". 

In the dropdown menu that appears, select "SingleStore Endpoints". The **Host URL** will then be displayed, and you can make a note of it for your use.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window click the **Create authentication** button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete. Please run the simplest operation available to test and make sure you can retrieve data as expected.
