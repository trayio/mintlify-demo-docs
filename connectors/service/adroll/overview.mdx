## Overview

The tray.io Adroll connector allows you to manage deliveries in Adroll.

## Authentication

When using the Adroll connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

On the following page proceed to allow Tray access to your account.

## Example

In this example we will build a simple workflow to retrieve a list of domain deliveries from an AdRoll account.

Create a new workflow with a **Manual Trigger**, and add a step from the **AdRoll** connector, with the operation set to **List domain deliveries**. Add two Breakdowns, the first one set to "Entity" and the second set to "Summary". Select an *Advertisable EID* from the dropdown list. Set the *Past days* parameter to a number sufficiently high to capture results. In this case we set the number to 300:

The output will be an object with both "Summary" and "Entity" properties.
