# Overview

## Overview

15Five is the complete performance management platform that creates effective managers, highly engaged employees, and top-performing organizations.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the 15Five connector is https://`{sub_domain}`.15five.com/api/public. More information can be found on their [main site](https://my.15five.com/api/public/).

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the 15Five connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'access_token' and 'sub_domain' 

To get the 'access_token', head to the 15Five dashboard. Click on the settings gear in the top, right-hand corner of 15Five.

Select 'Features' from the dropdown menu.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on '[Integrations](https://my.15five.com/integrations/)'.

Click **Enable** to the right of the Public API option.

Once enabled, you'll land on the '[Company API keys](https://my.15five.com/api/manage/company/)' page. Click the **Create new key** button.

Add in a short name for your API key. This name can be anything, but we suggest using a name that's easily identifiable from your server-side. If you would like to limit the API access to High Fives only, check that box before saving. Then, click **Save**.

More info on this can be found [here](https://success.15five.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002699631-API#h_01G6X8X5ZAS1A1VG4A0S4FGP6S)

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button. 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Using the Raw HTTP Request ('Universal Operation')

As of **version 1.0**, you can effectively create your own operations.

This is a powerful feature that you can use when there is an endpoint in 15Five that is not used by any of our operations.

To use this, you will first of all need to research the endpoint in the [15Five public API documentation](https://my.15five.com/api/public/) to **find the exact format** that 15Five will be expecting the endpoint to be passed in.

For example, say that the **List groups** operation did not exist in our 15Five connector, and you wanted to use this endpoint. You would use the , 15Five API docs to find the relevant endpoint - ***which in this case is a `GET` request called: `/group`****.*`* *`

More details about this endpoint can be found [here](https://my.15five.com/api/public/#group-list).

Based on the information provided in the above API call doc, you need to configure the following attributes on your Tray platform:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL: **

- **Body Type: **None

Once the API call is executed successfully,  you should get the following results:
