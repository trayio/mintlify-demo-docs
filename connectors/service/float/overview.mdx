# Overview

## Overview

The float connector makes resource planning simple.

## Authentication

When using the float connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

You will need to enter the API Key.

- Log into your Float account and click and the **settings icon** in the top right
- Select **Integrations**
- Copy the **API Key**

You can then **paste** the **API Key** into the tray authentication page.

## Example

In this example we build a simple workflow to retrieve the list of projects from float.

Create a new workflow with a **Manual Trigger**, and add a step from the **float** connector, with the operation set to **List Projects**. You can specify some properties, such as *Page* or *Per Page*.

The output will be an object with a the domain overview from each database.
