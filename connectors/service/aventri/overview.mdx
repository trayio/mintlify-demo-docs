## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Aventri connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your Aventri 'Account ID',  'API key', and 'Host region'.

To get these fields, more information can be found in the Aventri [documentation.](https://developer.aventri.com/#getting-an-api-key)

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
