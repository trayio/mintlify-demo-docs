# Overview

## Overview

The tray.io PandaDoc connector allows you to create and send templated documents in PandaDoc.

## Authentication

When using the Pandadoc connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

Ensure you allow Tray read and write access to fully utilise our connector. The Authentication Title will be automatically generated:

## Available Operations

The examples below show one or two of the available connector operations in use.

Please see the [Full Operations Reference](#operationsFull) at the end of this page for details on all available operations for this connector.

## Note on operation usage

### Formatting your Input

It is important to format your input fields correctly when working with Pandadoc. This is especially true when working with the 'List helper'.

The existing implementation signals a type error when you give a list type for sections, which prevents drag and drop connections within the 'List helper' from working correctly.

Please see the following [Pandadoc documentation](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/create-doc-from-sheet-example) page for more details on how to correctly format your Pandadoc input fields.

### Template uuid

The ID of a template you want to use. You can copy it from an in app template url such as https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates/{ID}/content. A template ID is also obtained by listing templates.

## Example

The following workflow has been created using a Manual Trigger and three operations from the PandaDoc connector.

Use the **List templates** operation to return an array of templates in your PandaDoc account (note we have switched to the **Debug** tab to view the output):

Use the **ID** field returned in the results as the **Template uuid** property in the **Create document from template** operation:

Use the **ID** field returned in the results of the **Create document from template** operation to query the **Get document status** operation to check whether the document was created:

The **status** field returned in the results should read 'document.draft' if the document was successfully uploaded and created.
