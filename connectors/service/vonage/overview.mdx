# Overview

## Overview

Vonage is a flexible cloud communications platform helping companies to engage their customers across messaging, voice, video, and other channels.

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Vonage connector, to retrieve information about your calls.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and Vonage connector to list calls
2. Loop through the list of calls
3. Get information on each call

### 1 - Setup Trigger & Vonage connector to list payments

Once you have clicked 'Create new workflow' from your main Tray.io dashboard named it, select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available:

From the connectors panel on the left, add a Vonage connector to your workflow. Set the operation to 'List calls'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

You can also filter the list of calls using the available fields on the properties panel. In our example, we will retrieve all the calls with 'Ringing' status.

Once this is setup, we are now returning all the ringing calls.

### 2 - Loop through the list of calls

Next, search for the Loop collection connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Vonage connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List calls' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `calls` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

### 3 - Get information on each call

The last step is to drag a Vonage connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get call'. As you can see, the 'Call ID' field is required.

Again use the 'Call ID' mapping icon to generate the connector-snake, this time hover the tail over the 'loop-2' step and select `uuid` from the output properties.

The step is now setup and this will return each call with 'ringing' status.

By running the workflow and going to the 'Debug' panel, you will be able to see the result. The 'Loop Collection' will result in potentially running the 'Vonage-1' step multiple times for all the items found in the 'Vonage-2' step.
