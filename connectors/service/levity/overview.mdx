# Overview

## Overview

Levity is a no-code AI workflow automation platform that simplifies creating AI for documents, images or text and removes repetitive tasks to increase productivity.

## **API Information **

The Base URL used for the Levity connector is **https://api.levity.ai/v1**. More information can be found on their main [API documentation(v1)](https://levityaidocs.netlify.app/docs/index) site.

## Authentication

Within the builder, click on the Levity connector to display the connector properties panel. Select the 'Auth' tab and click on the 'New authentication' button.

In the Tray.io authentication pop-up modal, name the authentication in a way that will quickly identify it within a potentially large list. For example, whether it is a Sandbox or Production auth, etc.

Consider who/ how many people will need access to this authentication when choosing where to create this authentication ('Personal' or 'Organisational').

The second page asks you for your 'Client ID' and 'Secret' credentials.

To get these fields, head to the Levity dashboard. Click on Settings.

Click on the 'API Tokens' button, then click on the 'Generate Token' button.

Generate a token by entering a 'Description' and selecting 'Roles'.

Click on the  'Create' button to generate the token.

Get the 'Client ID' and 'Secret'. Copy and Save them because they will not be shown again.

Once you have added these fields to your Tray.io authentication pop-up window, click the 'Create authentication' button.Â 

Your connector authentication setup should now be complete.
