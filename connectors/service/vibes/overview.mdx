# Overview

## Overview

Vibes provide a platform to automate engagement and manage all mobile communication channels to deliver dynamic consumer experiences.

Below is an example of a way in which you could potentially use the Vibes connector, to list all broadcasts and retrieve the information for each broadcast.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Setup using a manual trigger and List all the scheduled broadcasts.
2. Add a Loop connector to iterate through all the broadcasts from previous step.
3. Get details of each broadcast.

Your completed workflow should look similar to this:

### 1 - Setup Trigger & List broadcasts

Select the Manual trigger from the trigger options available.

From the connectors panel on the left, add a Vibes connector to your workflow. Set the operation to 'List broadcasts'.

Feel free to re-name your steps as you go along to make things clearer for yourself and other users. The operation names themselves often suffice.

### 2 - Add a Loop connector

Next, search for the Loop collection connector within your connector panel, and drag it into your workflow as your next step. Set your operations to 'Loop list'.

The Loop Collection connector allows you to iterate through a list of results. In this example, we will use it to iterate through the data found within the previous Vibes connector step.

In order to specify the list you want to loop through, start by using the list mapping icon (found next to the list input field, within the properties panel) to generate the connector-snake.

While hovering over the 'List broadcasts' step (with the tail end of the connector-snake), select `results` from the list of output properties displayed. This will auto-populate a jsonpath within your list input field, and update the type selector to jsonpath.

For more clarification on the pathways you have available, open the Debug panel to view your step's Input and Output.

When run, this workflow will iterate through the list of broadcats provided by the earlier step.

### 3 - Get broadcast

The last step is to drag a Vibes connector **inside** of the Loop Collection step itself. Set the operation to 'Get broadcast'. As you can see, the 'Broadcast ID' field is required.

Use the connector-snake to find the jsonpath for the 'Broadcast ID' field from the loop step. It should appear simillar to this: `$.steps.loop-1.value.broadcast_id`.

When run, the workflow will now iterate through the list of broadcasts, and get information for each broadcast.
