## Basic operation list

## Example - Searching users

To search for users with values in certain fields, the `Search system users` operation can be used.

If not all fields are required for the found users, then the fields name that are required can be listed, as shown below.

Filters can be used to search for user with specific properties. First, you can choose how the filters should be evaluated together. To match any of the filters, `Or` can be chosen. To only return results that match ALL the filters, please select `And`.

To filter on specific fields, enter the field name and the value it should match.

Using the `Limit` and `Offset` fields, pagination can be achieved.
