# Overview

## Overview

DocuSign allows businesses to prepare and manage agreements with customers and employees using electronic signatures.

## Authentication

When using the DocuSign connector, the first thing you will have to do is click on 'New Authentication' in the step editor:

On the next screen, you can select whether this is a production or sandbox account, and give the authentication a name. You must tick the box confirming that you grant full read and write access in your account, and then click 'Add authentication':

A pop-window will then open where you can log in to your DocuSign account:

If your details are correct, the window will close and the authentication will be created.
