# Overview

## Overview

The Form Trigger can be used to capture information from End Users via a webform and use this to kick off a workflow based on the information that has been captured, which can then be fed to other connectors.

An example of the Form Trigger in use can be seen in our [Simple Workflow Tutorial](https://tray.io/documentation/platform/getting-started/intro-tutorials/simple-slack-workflow/)

The above tutorial takes you through how to create a webform such as:

The form you create will be accessible by your End Users at the public URL available from your workflow settings:

## Using Webform Data

Each time a user enters and submits the form, you can extract the data submitted for use in subsequent connector steps. Clicking on the debug tab will show the submitted data:

In the above example you could obtain the data with the following jsonpaths:<br/>`$.steps.trigger.result.email`<br/>`$.steps.trigger.result.suggestion`

Please see the above tutorial for an example of this data being used to send a simple message to a Slack channel. This will demonstrate how webform data can be manipulated and sent to any connector.

## Customising form CSS and adding JS

You can customise your form by adding personalised CSS and Javascript as you would do for any standard webpage. 

Click on the **Show Advanced Properties** button to view these editing options:

**This workflow is available for you to **[import](#)** (right click and 'save as') **if you would like to see some applied custom CSS/JS in action.

## Using your own custom webforms

If you wish to use a custom webform you have previously built without Tray, then it is possible to submit its form data using a webhook, whereby you set the above Workflow public URL to receive the webhook data. Please see our [Webhook Trigger page](#) for an example webhook setup.
