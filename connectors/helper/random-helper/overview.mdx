# Overview

## Random Helpers overview

The Random Helper connector allows you to generate random values.

## Operations

## Random hex

This operation can be used to generate a random hex value:

## Random item

This operation can be used to select a random item from a list - e.g. to select a random sales rep id to randomly allocate a prospect to a sales rep:

## Random number

This operation can be used to generate a random number. You can specify if it is to be returned as a string or integer, as well as the smallest and biggest values:

## Random property

This operation can be used to randomly select a key/value pair from an object. This is useful in cases where a list of options is presented within an object rather than an array:

## Random string

This operation can be used to generate a random string.

You can specify `characters_set` `minimum_length` and `maximum_length`:

## Random UUID

This operation can be used to generate a random UUID:

It requires no inputs and returns a random UUI in the output payload e.g.:

`{"result": "4d2c9489-9628-4bce-ad96-df0f3cde102e"}`<br/>
