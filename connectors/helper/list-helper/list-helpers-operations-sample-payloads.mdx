**Sample Output**

### Get item by index

Given a list of items, retrieve the one at a specified index.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

### Get numbers between

Given a minimum and maximum value, get a list of all of the numbers in between the two. Includes both the minimum and maximum numbers too.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

### Intersection

For two given lists, return only the items that exist in both lists.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

### Iterative transform

Given a list, iterates through the enumerable components, and transforms the associated values accordingly.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

### Join

Join all items in a list together as a string, separated by a separator.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

### Last

Given a list of items, get the last one.
